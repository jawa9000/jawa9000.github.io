                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Axway Appcelerator Mobile Solution Platform</strong> manages the entire <a
                        href="#">lifecycle</a> of a mobile application from creation of
                    cross-platform mobile apps to <a href="#">collecting analytics</a> and <a href="#">testing</a>, <a
                        href="#">debugging</a>, <a href="#">deploying</a>, and <a href="#">crash monitoring</a> and more
                    all using one language (JavaScript). Mobile applications built with this platform are run
                    against a standalone JavaScript engine which invokes native APIs. As a developer, you are in fact
                    writing a native application - it's just that you're using cross-platform JavaScript rather than
                    non-portable Java or Objective-C.</p>
                <p>At a high-level, this platform is the combination of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#">Titanium SDK</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Appcelerator Studio</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Modules</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Appcelerator CLI</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Alloy</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Appcelerator Dashboard</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">API Builder</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">API Runtime Services</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Mobile Backend Services</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">App Designer</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">App Preview</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#">Mobile Analytics</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Titanium SDK</h2>
                <p>The <a href="#">Titanium SDK tools</a> combine your JavaScript source code, a JavaScript interpreter,
                    and your static
                    assets into an <a href="#">application binary</a> that will be installed to an <a
                        href="#">emulator</a> or <a href="#">mobile device</a>.
                    Fortunately for you, <a href="#AppceleratorStudio">Appcelerator Studio</a> will manage almost every
                    aspect of this build chain, leaving you to
                    focus on building your apps.</p>
                <h2>Appcelerator Studio</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">Appcelerator Studio</a></strong> (Studio) is Appcelerator's free <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> (integrated
                    development environment). You can use Studio to write, test,
                    and debug your mobile applications. Studio also has integrated templates and sample applications to
                    make it even easier to get started creating your own apps. In addition, Studio will help you manage
                    <a href="#">Titanium SDK updates</a> and <a href="#">module usage</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Appcelerator CLI</h2>
                <p>The <strong><a href="#">Appcelerator CLI</a></strong> is a set of command-line tools to develop and
                    deploy
                    mobile and cloud applications. The Appcelerator CLI provides a unified interface for using the
                    other Appcelerator command-line tools, such as the <a href="#">Titanium CLI</a>, <a href="#">Alloy
                        CLI</a>, and <a href="#">API
                        Runtime Services CLI</a>.</p>
                <h2>Hyperloop</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">Hyperloop</a></strong> gives you direct access to the native APIs. Titanium SDK
                    already
                    covers plenty of the native APIs and makes them cross-platform addressing the most popular APIs.
                    This technology was built for those developers who require access to even the most obscure APIs
                    out there. Hyperloop is available on all Platform tiers and apps that are registered with the <a
                        href="#">AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services</a>.</p>
                <h2>Alloy</h2>
                <p>The <strong><a href="#">Alloy</a> framework</strong> is designed to rapidly develop quality Titanium
                    applications. Alloy is based on the model-view-controller architecture and contains built-in
                    support for <a href="#">Backbone.js</a> and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a>.
                </p>
                <h2>Appcelerator Dashboard</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">Appcelerator Dashboard</a></strong> is a web application you use to manage all
                    aspects of
                    your AMPLIFY Appcelerator Services development. You can manage Titanium applications, as well as
                    iOS and Android applications built with Objective-C (or Swift) and Java. It enables you to
                    create, deliver, analyze, and manage your mobile apps.</p>
                <h2>API Builder</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">Axway API Builder</a></strong> provides various backend services, including
                    analytics, that are
                    included in our list of Titanium components. <a href="#">Titanium analytics</a> provide basic
                    usage-level
                    statistics, including how often your app is used and on which platforms. You can even log custom
                    analytics events so that you can track the use of specific features, like button clicks, data
                    access, or any other type of user interaction. These services are provided transparently to the
                    developer via the core API.</p>
                <h2>Mobile Backend Services</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">Mobile Backend Services</a></strong> (MBS) provides pre-built,
                    automatically-scaled network services, and data objects for your client applications. MBS can be
                    integrated with your Titanium, Node.js, Android, or iOS application and also provide the ability to
                    send push notifications to Android and iOS devices subscribed to push channels.</p>
                <h2>App Designer</h2>
                <p>The <strong><a href="#">Appcelerator App Designer</a></strong> is an integrated WYSIWYG layout
                    design tool for developing mobile applications using <a href="#">Appcelerator Titanium</a>. App
                    Designer
                    features two views: <strong>Design</strong> and <strong>XML</strong>.
                    The Design view allows you to have an editor view for both your design and layout while the XML
                    views allows you to view your code.</p>
                <h2>App Preview</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">App Preview</a></strong> is an Appcelerator Studio feature that allows you to
                    distribute beta
                    versions of your apps to testers and stakeholders. Users should be able to upload their beta apps to
                    App Preview.</p>
                <p>App Preview supports the <a href="#">Android and iOS platforms</a> and comes along with <a
                        href="#">CLI hook</a> installed with the
                    App core.</p>
                <h2>Mobile Analytics</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="#">Mobile Analytics</a></strong> collects and presents information in real time
                    about how your
                    application's user acquisition, engagement, and usage. By default, it provides the number of
                    applications installs, the number of sessions, and the average application session length
                    organized by application name, platform and geography. Your application can send
                    custom analytic events, which are collected and logged, to learn how users use
                    your application. You can also create <em>event funnels</em> - ordered sets of custom events
                    that correspond to a business process or application flow you want to track as a whole.
                </p>
                <h2>Titanium at 10,000 feet</h2>
                <p>Titanium exists as a bridge between the native operating system and your app's code.</p>
                <p>At the bottom of the stack is the client operating system: iOS and Android. At the top is your app
                    built JavaScript. In between, is the <a href="#">Titanium SDK</a> and the <a href="#">APIs</a> it
                    exposes. You write your app in
                    JavaScript, calling on the Titanium APIs to take actions like drawing buttons, opening windows,
                    utlizing the camera, and so on. The Titanium bridge (part of the SDK) translates those calls into
                    their native equivalents. In other words, when you create a Titanium button, it's actually a proxy
                    for a true native button. When you modify the Titanium button, say to change its label or add an
                    event listener, the SDK applies corresponding changes to the native equivalent. When events occur in
                    native-land, the SDK bubbles them up to your JavaScript code.</p>
