                    <p>Appcelerator Analytics collects real-time data about your application's usage which can then be
                        viewed in the <strong><a href="#">Analytics dashboard</a></strong>. By default, the Analytics
                        dashboard provides information about app installs, number of sessions, and average app session
                        length (organized by app name, platform, and geography). Your app can also utilize custom analytic
                        events and event funnels.</p>
                    <p>This document provides an overview of the features provided by Analytics, and how
                        to use them using the <a href="#">Titanium SDK</a>. <strong>If you are developing an iOS application
                            with Objective-C or Swift or an Android application with Java</strong>, see
                        <a href="#">APS Analytics for iOS</a> or <a href="#">APS Analytics for Android</a> for details on using Analytics.</p>

                    <p>For platform-specific details about how analytics captured, see <a href="#">Analytics Architecture</a></p>
                    <p>For information about viewing analytics data, see <a href="#">Managing Client Applications</a>

                    <p><strong>Analytics</strong> refers to data about how your application has been used, as well as
                        information about how users interact with your application. Analytics data is transmitted in the
                        form of <em>events</em>.</p>
                    <p>Events are operational milestones in the application. Some events are generated
                        automatically, such as those that mark ake sure your application is selected. installation, or the beginning and end of a
                        session. Others may be <strong>custom events</strong>, which have a meaning
                        specific to an application, such as tapping a specific button or opening a certain
                        window.</p>
                    <p><strong>A feature event represents an action</strong> a user could take in
                        an application, such as 'liking an item' or launching a video'. Applications
                        use the <a href="#">Titanium</a> or <a href="#">APSAnalytics API</a> to create custom events.</p>
                    <p><strong>Event funnels</strong> let you define custom, ordered event sequences that let you
                        track a specific user process, such as finding a product and making a purchase.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Analytics dashboard</strong> organizes, analyzes, and presents analytics data
                        captured for your applications. You also use the Analytics dashboard to create and view
                        event funnels.</p>

                    <h2 id="GettingstartedwithAnalytics">Getting started with Analytics</h2>
                    <p>Enabling analytics is enabled by default when creating an project using <strong>Appcelerator
                            Studio</strong> (Studio). If for some reason it's not enabled, you can enable <strong>Axway
                            Appcelerator Platform Services</strong> in the project's <code class="inline">tiapp.xml</code> and deploy
                        your application.</p>
                    <p><strong>To enable analytics in a new Appcelerator project</strong>:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In <strong>Studio</strong>, create a new Mobile Application (<strong>File
                            </strong>&gt;<strong> New Mobile App Project...</strong>).</li>
                        <li>Make sure the <strong>Enable Axway Appcelerator Platform Services</strong> option is enabled
                            in the New Mobile App Project dialog, and select the appropriate organization from the
                            Organization pop-up menu. The application is tied to the account and organization used to
                            create it.<br /><img src="../images/60490037.png" width="750px"></li>
                        <li>Enter the rest of the required project information and click <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Build your application and deploy to devices to begin collecting analytics data.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Next steps</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once deployed, you can begin to view data captured for your application in the <a
                                href="#">Analytics dashboard</a>.</li>
                        <li>Use <a href="#">custom events</a> to track basic usage and navigation patterns.</li>
                        <li>Create <a href="#">event funnels</a> to better analyze a specific process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Enabling Appcelerator Services modifies your project's <code class="inline">tiapp.xml</code> file
                        and
                        other applications files. Do not modify these code changes as it may break your project.
                        See <a href="#">Platform Services</a> for details on what changes are made to your
                        code.</p>
                    <h2 id="Creatingcustomevents">Creating custom events</h2>
                    <p>The <code class="inline"><a href="#">Titanium.Analytics</a></code> API can be used to send custom
                        events and data, called feature events.</p>
                    <h3 id="Featureevents">Feature events</h3>
                    <p><code class="inline"><a href="#">Titanium.Analytics.featureEvent(name, data)</a></code> is used
                        to send a feature event. A feature event can be used to represent a user action, application
                        state or send a data payload.</p>
                    <p>Feature event names should be as generic as possible and without spaces (e.g:
                        &quot;<em>home_window.open</em>&quot; instead of &quot;<em>Home Window Open</em>&quot;).
                        This allows events to be easily consolidated and queried from Dashboard.</p>
                    <p>User actions can be logged using feature events, here's an example of logging a user
                        opening the home window of an app.</p>
                    <code class="block">
                        // Detect when home window is opened.<br/>
                        home_window.addEventListener(&#39;open&#39;, e =&gt; {<br/>
                        <span class="indent1">// Send analytics feature event to log user action.</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent1">Ti.Analytics.featureEvent(&#39;home_window.open&#39;);</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent1">...</span><br/>
                        });
                    </code>
                    <p>In some cases, additional data can also be sent which can be queried on Dashboard. In this
                        example, an analytics event is sent when the user backgrounds their app.</p>

                    <code class="block">
                        // Detect when application is backgrounded.<br/>
                        Ti.App.addEventListener(&#39;paused&#39;, e =&gt; {<br/>
                        <span class="indent1">// Send analytics feature event with payload.</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent1">// In this example, the user may have added items to their shopping basket but decided to exit the app.</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent1">// We can log how many items were in the users basket and query this data on Dashboard.</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent1">Ti.Analytics.featureEvent(&#39;shopping_basket.backgrounded&#39;, {</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent2">items: shopping_basket.count</span><br/>
                        <span class="indent1">});</span><br/>
                        <br/>
                        <span class="indent1">...</span><br/>
                        });
                    </code>
                    <p>We can then create a custom query in Dashboard to calculate the average number of items users had
                        in their basket upon backgrounding the application.</p>

                        example, the user has created an event funnel named &quot;Product Purchase&quot; that tracks the

                        <li>Select <strong>Event Funnels</strong> from the Analytics menu. Your application's current
                            event funnels are displayed if any exist.</li>
                        <li>Click <strong>+</strong> (add) button to create a new event funnel.</li>
                        <li>Enter a <strong>name</strong> for your event funnel.</li>
                        <li><strong>Drag two or more custom events</strong> from the left column to the right column. Enter the name of an event in the Custom Events text field to filter available events by name. To get custom events to appear on this list, you must build your application and trigger each event to ensure that the events are registered with the analytics engine.
                        </li>
                        <li>To re-order an event drag its reorder control up or down in the event list. Keep in mind
                            that the order of the events you include is significant in terms of how the event funnel
                            data is analyzed and presented.
                        </li>
                        <li>Remove an event by clicking the '<strong>X</strong>' next to its name.</li>
                        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to save the event funnel.
