                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>In Snapser's architecture, developers utilize a modular approach, selecting and integrating specific components tailored to their game's needs. For instance, for an asynchronous multiplayer game, developers can choose functionalities like authentication, analytics, storage, and leaderboards from the Snapser Marketplace. Furthermore, they can incorporate custom features, microservices, or macroservices developed internally through the Snapser portal, enabling a customizable backend solution by seamlessly integrating desired components.
                        <br/>
                        The following image illustrates an asynchronous multiplayer game with authentication, analytics, storage, and a leaderboard, supplemented by a custom feature engineered by the game's developers.</p>

                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>As the game grows, you decide to introduce a real-time multiplayer feature to your game. You can update your existing Snapend, incorporating everything from the previous step along with the real-time relay snaps. Consequently, you will have a new customized Snapend capable of supporting both asynchronous and real-time multiplayer features.</p>

                        <p>Some time later, you opt to launch a new game, significantly more ambitious in scope. This project necessitates multiplayer functionalities, a real-time relay, and authoritative servers. You can proceed to establish your own Snapend encompassing multiplayer services, a real-time relay, and a server fleet to meet these requirements.</p>
