Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p><p><strong>Additional Regional Effects</strong></p><p>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:</p><p><strong>Blue Luster</strong>. Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.</p><p><strong>Mirage Terrain</strong>. The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.</p><p><strong>Sandstorm</strong>. A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the lair.</p>",
    "notes": "<p><strong>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</strong></p><p>This dragon can innately cast three spells, once per day each, requiring no material components. Each spell's level can be no higher than 4th. The dragon's spell save DC is DC 19, and it has +9 to hit with spell attacks.</p><p>A suggested spell list is shown below, but you can also choose spells to reflect the dragon's character. A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells. You can also give a dragon spells of a higher level than this rule allows, but such a tweak might increase the dragon's challenge rating—especially if those spells deal damage or impose conditions on targets.</p><p><ul><li>lightning bolt</li><li>thunderwave</li><li>gust of wind</li></ul></p>",

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</li><li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li><li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Additional Lair Actions</strong></p><p>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p><p><strong>Blinding Sleet.</strong> Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><p><strong>Whirling Wind.</strong> A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.</p>",

Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.</li><li>If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li></ul></p><p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p><p><strong>Additional Regional Effects</strong></p><p>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:</p><p><strong>Biting Chill</strong>. Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.</p><p><strong>Mirror Ice</strong>. The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ancient black dragons are the most cunning and intelligent of all chromatic dragons. They are also the most sadistic, taking pleasure in the suffering of others.

They are able to breathe a cone of acid that can melt through even the toughest armor, and they can also create pools of acid that can trap and destroy their enemies.</p><p>In addition to their magical abilities, ancient black dragons are also formidable physical combatants. They have powerful jaws and claws that can tear through flesh and bone, and they are able to fly at incredible speeds, making them difficult to catch or evade.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands. Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon’s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon’s first line of defense. A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions — along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>",

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</li><li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li><li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Additional Lair Actions</strong></p><p>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p><p><strong>Blinding Sleet.</strong> Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><p><strong>Whirling Wind.</strong> A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.</p>",
    "regional effects": "<p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p><ul><li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li><li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.</li><li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.</li><li>If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li></ul></p><p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p><p><strong>Additional Regional Effects</strong></p><p>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:</p><p><strong>Biting Chill</strong>. Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.</p><p><strong>Mirror Ice</strong>. The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.</p>",

    "description": "Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail.</p><p>A dragon turtle's rough shell is the same dark green color as the deep water where this monster dwells. Silver highlights lining the shell resemble light dancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the waves.</p><p><strong>Dragons of the Deep</strong>. Like true dragons, dragon turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair.</p><p>Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt to take over.</p><p><strong>Mercenary Monsters</strong>. A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.</p><p><strong>Elemental Might</strong>. Dragon turtles sometimes find their way through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Plane of Water. Those monstrous specimens can often be found in the service of marids, which strap magnificent coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride them as mounts.</p>"

For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p><p><em><strong>Invisible Passage.</strong></em> The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</p>",

    "liar action": "<p>The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.</p><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><p><ul><li>Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.</li><li>The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.</li></ul></p><p>A powerful green hag might have the following additional lair action:</p><p><ul><li>The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its possession.</li></ul></p>",
    "regional effects": "<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.</p><p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p><ul><li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li><li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li><li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.</li></ul></p><p>A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p><p><ul><li>Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.</li><li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li><li>Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Hag Covens</strong></p><p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</p><p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</p><p><em><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong></em>. While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:</p><p><ul><li>1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</li><li>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</li><li>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</li><li>4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</li><li>5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</li><li>6th level (1 slot): eyebite</li></ul></p><p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.</p><p><strong>Hag Eye</strong>. A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p><p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</p>"

The dancing creature is incapacitated and must use all its movement to dance.</p><p><strong>Disorienting Visions</strong>. Disorienting illusory images flit through the dragon's lair.

    "regional effects": "<p>The region surrounding a legendary moonstone dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:</p><p><strong>Dream Communication</strong>. Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.</p><p><strong>Planar Transition</strong>. The veil between planes is thinned near a moonstone dragon's lair. Various portals link the Material Plane, the Feywild, and the Border Ethereal within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures can pass through a portal in either direction by spending 5 feet of movement.</p><p><strong>Portal Closure</strong>. If the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, the portals near its lair close immediately, and the planar transition effect ends.</p><p>These effects last until the dragon dies or moves more than 6 miles from its lair.</p><p><strong>Customizing Dragons</strong></p><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>. Most dragons are proficient in the Perception and Stealth skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.</p><p><em><strong>Other Traits and Actions</strong></em>. You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:</p><p><strong>Flyby. The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.</p><p><strong>The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</p><p><strong>Mimicry. Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.</p><p><strong>The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p><p><strong>Rejuvenation. You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery. If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.</p><p><strong>Special Senses</strong>. Most dragons have blindsight and darkvision. You might upgrade blindsight to truesight, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed tremorsense.</p>",

While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk).

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature that enters the blizzard for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p>",
    "regional effects": "<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.</p><p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p><ul><li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li><li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li><li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.</li></ul></p><p>A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p><p><ul><li>Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.</li><li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li><li>Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Hag Covens</strong></p><p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</p><p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</p><p><em><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong></em>. While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:</p><p><ul><li>1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</li><li>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</li><li>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</li><li>4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</li><li>5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</li><li>6th level (1 slot): eyebite</li></ul></p><p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.</p><p><strong>Hag Eye</strong>. A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p><p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</p>"

Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell.

Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</p><p><em><strong>Wishes</strong></em>. The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence. To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</p>",

The skull isn't visible while the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain, the statue shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is the nexus for the alchemy used to create these horrors, a dim echo of the original victim's memories resonates within the skull.

Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.</p><p>Vaprak's Blessing. After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.</p>"

Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.

    traits: "<p><em><strong>Shapechanger.</strong></em> If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In either case, if air can pass through a space, the mist can. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it can't be grappled, prone, pushed, restrained, or stunned. It takes no damage from nonmagical attacks. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p><p><em><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong></em> If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p><p><em><strong>Misty Escape.</strong></em> When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its true form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it regains 1 hit point.</p><p><em><strong>Regeneration.</strong></em> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Spider Climb.</strong></em> The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p><p><em><strong>Vampire Weaknesses.</strong></em> The vampire has the following flaws:<ul><li>Forbiddance: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</li><li>Harmed by Running Water: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.</li><li>Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</li><li>Sunlight Hypersensitivity: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight.

    "description": "<p>Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces. Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed. Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies. Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way. Undead Nature. Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air. A Vampire's Lair. A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night. PLAYER CHARACTERS AS VAMPIRES The game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Granted by powerful fey to individuals who please them, yeth hounds serve evil masters like hunting dogs. Yeth hounds fly in pursuit of their prey, often waiting until it is too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding. Minions of a Dark Master. A pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Once it is brought into existence, a pack must have a master, who is often someone the creator wishes to reward. The master can telepathically communicate with its yeth hounds to give them commands from afar. If the master of a pack is killed, the hounds seek and choose a new master, typically an individual of great evil such as a vampire, a necromancer, or a hag. A yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Often all that can be seen of one in the darkness is the red glow of its eyes against its night-black fur. The head of a yeth hound has a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than a dog's. The creature gives off an odor like smoke. Sound of Looming Death. Yeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that can be heard all around. Creatures that can see a hound when it bays are filled with supernatural fear and usually flee in terror. When a victim tries to run away, a hound delights in chasing after it and tormenting it before bringing the hunt to a close.</p><p>Those that stand their ground and fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through the hound as if it was made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.</p><p>Foiled by Sunlight. Yeth hounds can't stand sunlight. A pack never willingly prolongs a hunt beyond the night hours and always seeks to return to its dark den before the first rays of dawn. No amount of coercion by a pack's master can deter this behavior. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, from where its master can retrieve it only after the sun has set.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Zariel. Zariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane's corrupting influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the Nine Hells. All who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say over who comes and goes. Given her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of it. However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a result, Zariel's servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.</p><p>Zariel's Lair. Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams and moans coming from the burned victims chained to the stronghold's wall, the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.</p>"

Utterly inhuman, Zuggtmoy can mold her fungoid form into an approximation of a humanoid shape, including the skeletal-thin figure depicted in grimoires and ancient art, draped and veiled in mycelia and lichen. Indeed, much of her appearance and manner, and that of her servants, is a soulless mockery of mortal life and its many facets. Zuggtmoy's cultists often follow her unwittingly. Most are fungi-infected to some degree, whether through inhaling her mind-controlling spores or being transformed to the point where flesh and fungus become one. Such cultists are fungal extensions of the Demon Queen's will. Their devotion might begin with the seemingly harmless promises offered by exotic spores and mushrooms, but quickly consumes them, body and soul.</p><p>Zuggtmoy's Lair. Zuggtmoy's principal lair is her palace on Shedaklah. It consists of two dozen mushrooms of pale yellow and rancid brown. These massive fungi are some of the largest in existence.

The mushrooms themselves are all interconnected by bridges of shelf-fungi, and countless chambers have been hollowed out from within their rubbery, fibrous stalks.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Deathpact angels dwell in the grandest of Orzhov cathedrals, where they surround themselves with wealth and wretched vassals that are utterly in their thrall. Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact angel attracts petitioners who beg the angel for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts. Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter). Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power. Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.</p>"

However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters. Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the Seelie Court.

    "description": "<p>Despite frequent shifts in leadership among other archdevils, Dispater has maintained his position as the ruler of Dis since its creation. Known for his vigilance and caution, he rarely leaves his tower, and even less frequently leaves the Iron City. Those who know his plans, including Asmodeus, know that he hopes to one day rule each layer of the Nine Hells. Dispater remains one of the foremost suppliers of weapons across all the planes, which helps keep his position in Dis secure. As well, his advisors are carefully chosen and he maintains very few friendships. Those that attempt battle with the Iron Lord find victory nigh impossible. In addition to his stratagem and defense, Dispater maintains extremely powerful abilities and a legion of minions. Outwitting him can't be done, and anyone unfortunate enough to catch him off guard is quickly disposed of.</p><p>Dispater remains calm and controlled in conversation. He prefers wherever possible to engage in gentlemanly debates rather than aggressive arguments. Unlike other archdevils, he almost never forces an individual into doing something, preferring to persuade or deceive instead. Fittingly, his skin is an iron-black color and his signature staff, wrought from the same iron as the tower he lives in, is always in hand.</p>",

If the creature is harmed by Flesh to Iron again, while still partly iron, the rest of the creature also turns to iron, killing them.</p><p><strong>Call Underling (Costs 3 Actions)</strong>.

The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.</p><p><strong>Cast a Spell</strong>. The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration instead.</p><p><strong>Deceitful Whispers</strong>. The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.</p><p><strong>Fiendish Fortitude</strong>. The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.</p><p><strong>Frenzy</strong>. The archdevil casts Haste on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.</p><p><strong>Summon Underlings</strong>. The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see.

The tempest drowns the land beneath it with rain and stabs the earth with lances of lightning. Punishing winds scream around it as it flies, feeding the chaos it creates.</p><p>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.</p><p>The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.</p><p>An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>"

    "notes": "<p><strong>Hag Covens.</strong> When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures.  A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group.  However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.  A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third.  While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </p><p>1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</p><p>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</p><p>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</p><p>4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</p><p>5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</p><p>6th level (1 slot): eyebite</p><p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability.  The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier. </p><p><strong>Hag Eye.</strong> A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item.  The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport.  A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence.  A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.  If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours. </p><p><strong>Iron Token.</strong> An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror.  Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the same plane of existence and within 10 miles of each other.  The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around the hag.  Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token and not the noise around it.  A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time.  As an action, she can discern the direction and approximate distance to all of her active tokens.  She can instantaneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magical properties. </p>",
    "description": "<p>Annis hags lair in mountains or hills.  Despite being hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall.  Although annis hags can easily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, preferring their flesh above all others.  They use the flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a hag's lair often shows the signs of this industry.  Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim.  In this way, they provoke fear and paranoia in nearby villages and settlements.  When an annis feels especially cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives it an iron token that it can use to confide in her.  Over time, \"Granny\" convinces the child that it's okay to have bad thoughts and do bad deeds.  Much in the way that they befriend children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls, or other loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, verbal abuse, and superstition. </p>"

Ash phoenixes are the animated ashes of mass funerary pyres, which seek the eradication of all life around their birth pyres.  For an ash phoenix to be created, a group of humanoids must be burned in a mass pyre in an area tainted with necrotic energy, and the blood of a magical avian, such as an august rooster or firebird, must be mixed into the pyre as it smolders.  The creation of the ash phoenix disrupts the natural passage of souls into the afterlife, infusing the phoenix with the angry spirits.  The presence of these spirits gives the ash phoenix some level of intelligence but also drives it to seek vengeance against all living creatures.  Ash phoenixes never stray more than a few miles from their birthplace and are reborn in those same ashes each time they are slain. </p>"

They have been gliding through the astral mists since the dawn of the multiverse, trying to devour all other creatures they encounter.  As big as an ancient red dragon and covered from head to tail in layers of thick, spiked plates, a dreadnought has two gnarled limbs that end in razor-sharp pincer claws. Constellations appear to swirl in the depths of its single eye, and its serpentine, armored tail trails off into the silvery void.  An astral dreadnought lives a solitary existence. On the rare occasion when two dreadnoughts meet, they typically fight until one tires of the conflict and departs.  An astral dreadnought doesn't have a gullet or a digestive system.  Anything it swallows is deposited in a unique demiplane—an enclosed space that contains eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of dead planar travelers.  Although it eats and sleeps if it so desires, an astral dreadnought doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. </p>"

Orcs that revere Bahgtru might tend a stable of war bulls that carry them into combat. Trained to be fierce mounts from a young age, aurochs are sacred symbols of Bahgtru. No orc will eat such creatures, which are treated as honored warriors when they perish.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Baalzebul, is an archdevil and the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. He is known as the Lord of the Flies because his tightly woven web of intrigue traps even the smallest fly. In recent centuries he has been cursed with a new hideous form by the Lord of the Nine Hells-Asmodeus. This form has earned him a new title-The Slug Archduke. Baalzebul was originally known as Triel, one of the most powerful and beautiful angels to be found in Celestia. Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch. However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted. Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil. Any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him. Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even if trapped in the form of a slug, he is still the Lord of Lies, whose every deception is made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind. Only other devils are safe from his lies, as Baalzebul wishes to return to his original beautiful form. If forced into combat Baalzebul's first tactic is to belch out gargantuan clouds of flesh-devouring flies. Baalzebul's stench is so putrid that simply trying to get anywhere close to him is sickening. Despite his bloated form, he can still burrow underground and easily scale surfaces. He is easy to track, since he always leaves a thick layer of putrid slime in his wake.</p>"

    "description": "<p>With the Blood War raging for eons and no end in sight, opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win fame, glory, and power in the ongoing struggle against the demons. Duke Bael, one of Mammon's most important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with leading sixty-six companies of barbed devils, Bael has proven to be a tactical genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael, because of his battle acumen, to safeguard his holdings. Mammon has never been ousted during a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, which is a testament to Bael's skill on the battlefield. For his accomplishments, as well as for the hue of his skin, Baal has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, Bael has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals. Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to Bael's superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats, but only if they pledge their souls and service to him. Although he is willing to corrupt almost any being in this way, he always destroys any demons he defeats. Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his own politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon's court, which leaves Bael free to pursue his battle lust. Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a male human, or some combination of these forms, though none of these images reflect his true appearance.</p>"

    "description": "<p>A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through vile magic, these components take on an enormous and horrific upright shape resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper that swallows the unwary. Hags have devised a ritual for creating banderhobbs-a hag who knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other wicked Fey and powerful Fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages. During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out its creator's bidding. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or causes. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or another object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away. A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of an ominous tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform and banderhobbs roam.</p>"

The creature emerges in the form of a goblin, then develops the ability to assume its true form: that of a large, fiendish canine. The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume seventeen goblinoid souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills. Souls consumed in this way are prevented from joining Maglubiyet's forces in Acheron. A barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn't kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, rather than lowly goblins, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying upon a goblin or two when the opportunity arises, until they reach adult age and are old and strong enough to seek out stronger prey. When goblins discover that a barghest is among them, they react with groveling obeisance, each member of the tribe eager to show the barghest that it isn't worthy of being devoured.</p>"

 "lair actions": "<p>The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure.

The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult. </p><p><strong>Moon Devils.</strong> Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter.  A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. </p><p>If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of 1d10 days, allowing plant life in the area to recover. </p>",

 "description": "<p>Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.  Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food;  she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves.  Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color.  Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age.  Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate. </p><p>Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves.  Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.  A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects.  In this semi-incorporeal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form. </p>"

 "description": "<p>The thunderous clash of conflict is part of the very nature of sapphire dragons.  Militant and territorial, they defend their lairs fiercely, ambushing intruders and plotting assaults against their rivals.  The sonic pulse of their breath weapon sows weakness, leaving the victims unable to fight back. </p><p>Sapphire dragons' scales and wing membranes show varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky to the rich, crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice.  In the light, the scales glitter and shine like luminous starbursts.  The dragons' psionic nature is evident in the horn and bone structures of their bodies.  Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in place, held aloft by psychic energy while the dragons live.  These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragons' moods, bobbing in amusement or flaring with anger. </p><p>The warlike sapphire dragons devise strategies and ambushes based on their ability to maneuver underground.  A sapphire dragon often refrains from striking immediately, preferring to assess intruders first in order to devise the most advantageous approach to dealing with them.  Sapphire dragons watch for signs of Aberrations and other creatures corrupted by the Far Realm.  They frequently ally with emerald dragons, drawing on their kin's knowledge of occult phenomena to track the influence of the Far Realm.  Armed with that knowledge, sapphire dragons stamp out alien influence before it spreads.  People who dwell or delve deep beneath the earth can easily find themselves at odds with a sapphire dragon if they cross into the dragon's territory.  But sapphire dragons sometimes forge peaceful relationships with rock gnomes or deep gnomes, relying on these folk to help protect the territory surrounding their lairs. </p><p>Sapphire dragons' favorite prizes are weapons and armor, records of military history and tactics, and magic items that protect against psychic damage or mental intrusion.  The centerpiece of a sapphire dragon's hoard is usually a cataloged, orderly collection of war gear, which can contain ancient relics of immense power.</p><p>Sapphire dragons make their homes in extensive cave systems.  As they grow older, they make increasingly complex renovations to their lairs, using their inherent magic and natural tunneling abilities to great effect.  Eventually, a sapphire dragon's lair is a dizzying honeycomb of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow the dragon to travel from one end to the other unseen by intruders.  The most secure lairs might feature no accessible entrances or exits at all, with the dragon relying on tunneling or shaping stone to come and go.  The challenge rating of a legendary sapphire dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Immortal and unpredictable, arch-hags hoard secrets and strike magical bargains, altering fate to indulge their fickle whims.  These timeless schemers pursue the secrets of the multiverse and work strange magic in pursuit of their inscrutable goals.  Arch-hags are unpredictable, self-interested, and greedy, with bizarre fascinations and affectations. Nevertheless, they often make deals to further their plots.  These hags are fonts of secret knowledge, particularly lore regarding forbidden magic and multiversal secrets.  They might share their knowledge, but their secrets always have a price.  In trade for their secrets, arch-hags might request peculiar errands, valuable magic items, or preternatural currency, like one's memories, a year of one's life, or the ability to cry.  Most arch-hags avoid battle, but if forced to fight, they unleash dangerous magic, such as spectral claws, arcing lightning, and mind-bending spells.  An arch-hag can curse other magic-users, confounding the spellcasters' incantations and forcing the spellcasters to say the opposite of what they mean.  Even if an arch-hag is brought low, its preparations allow it to magically slip away and begin plotting its revenge.  Every arch-hag has a unique weakness tied to a fateful encounter the hag had in the past or something that embodies the antithesis of the hag's magic.  A hag goes out of its way to keep this vulnerability secret.  Although an arch-hag isn't physically harmed by its weakness, it can be destroyed only while its weakness is nearby.  Roll on or choose a result from the Arch-hag Anathemas table to inspire an arch-hag's weakness. </p>"

      "<p>Ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds. Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash. Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture. An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size. Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words-and then being eaten in turn. Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers. An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on. Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons. Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants' complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.</p>",

      "<p>Vampirates are the walking, talking husks of dead pirates who refused to go quietly into the afterlife. They ply the void in their ships, plundering unsuspecting vessels and feeding on the life energy of those unlucky enough to cross their path. A vampirate appears as a gaunt figure with milky-white eyes and skin as dry as parchment. Some have a peg leg or a hook in place of a hand—mementos of a life of misadventure. A vampirate has fangs like a vampire's but doesn't use them to draw vital fluids from prey, which vampirates consider an unsavory act. Rather, a vampirate drains life energy from another creature by touching it or by siphoning off its energy from a short distance away. As it feeds on the energy of other creatures, its appearance becomes more robust, although it never truly looks alive. Vampirates eat, drink, and sleep because they like to, not because they must. They rest in wooden coffins or crates full of grave dirt. In the absence of such containers, they can treat their ship's hold as one big coffin and sleep amid their cargo. When they're not sleeping or marauding, a crew of vampirates whiles away the hours by drinking rum and singing grim chanteys. A ship crewed by vampirates usually has one or more shadows aboard—the Undead remains of some of the vampirates' victims.</p>",

      "<p>Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces. Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed. Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies. Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way. Undead Nature. Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air. A Vampire's Lair. A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.</p>",

      "<p>When the mind flayers of Bluetspur (see chapter 3) could find no cure for their overlord's affliction, their degenerating elder brain turned to radical methods to stave off dementia and death. The results were vampiric mind flayers, feral atrocities spawned from mind flayer tadpoles infected with vampirism. These specialized but flawed terrors serve a single purpose: to drain the cerebral fluids from sapient minds. After doing so, they return to the Elder Brain of Bluetspur, which liquefies them into its pool and releases their stolen essences amid a hormone brine. This grotesque balm stalls the elder brain's degeneration but is far from a cure. Vampiric mind flayers are physically and mentally unstable beings.

Indistinguishable from the mists they lurk within, they strike unseen and undetected to bleed their victims dry. Former Vampires. Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists, are all that remain of vampires who couldn't return to their burial places after being defeated or suffering some mishap. Denied the restorative power of these places, the vampires' bodies dissolve into mist. The transformation strips the intelligence and personality from them until only an unholy, insatiable thirst for blood remains. Blood Thief. Indistinguishable from fog aside from the charnel reek it exudes, a vampiric mist descends on a creature and causes the blood in its body to ooze through the creature's pores or spill out from its eyes, nose, and mouth. This blood wafts out from the victim like crimson smoke, which the mist then consumes. The feeding causes no pain or discomfort to the victim, so vampiric mists can feed on sleepers without waking them. The more a mist feeds, the redder it gets, such that it turns pink, then red, and finally a deep scarlet hue that rains blood droplets wherever it goes. Attracted to Blood. Like sharks in water, vampiric mists can scent blood from up to a mile away. Any injury, no matter how small, might catch their attention and draw them toward their victims. In battle, a mist focuses its attacks on injured targets, since open wounds are a more ready source of blood. Undead Nature. A vampiric mist doesn't require air or sleep.</p>",

A yuan-ti abomination's quest for godhood might lead it to perform a ritual that, if successful, transforms it into an even greater form: a yuan-ti anathema. This ritual demands the sacrifice of hundreds of snakes and requires the abomination to bathe in the blood of its enemies. The transformation is quick yet painful. Not all yuan-ti are eager to see one of their own become an anathema, since anathemas brutally subjugate their lessers for their own evil ends. Not Quite Divine. An anathema considers itself a demigod on the path to greater divinity.

These priests perform sacrificial rites to appease their vile gods. Yuan-ti Broodguard. Broodguards are humanoids transformed by yuan-ti into simple-minded, scaly creatures that do their masters\' bidding. The transformation process warps not only a subject\'s body but also its mind, making it instinctively obey any yuan-ti and filling it with a seething rage that rises at the sight of non-reptilian creatures. Although broodguards have low intelligence, they are able to perform simple yet important tasks in the community, such as guarding eggs or patrolling for intruders. The yuan-ti refer to broodguards as "histachii," which means "egg-watchers." Human No More. Most broodguards are made from human prisoners forced to consume a magical brew that renders them helpless and unable to fight off the inevitable. A human transformed into a broodguard loses all semblance of who it once was, and even its human origin is barely discernible. A broodguard is hairless and emaciated, with yellow-green, scaly skin. It has beady, bloodshot eyes and a forked tongue, and smells faintly of rotting meat. Broodguards can speak but rarely do so, preferring to use snake-like hisses and guttural noises. MAKING A BROODGUARD. Yuan-ti create broodguards from captured humanoids. Each subject is fed a special potion that immediately renders it incapacitated and transforms it into a broodguard over the next 1d6 + 6 days. A subject forced to imbibe the brew can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw; on a success, it takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and isn\'t otherwise affected. A spell such as lesser restoration or remove curse can end the transformation process at any time before it runs its course. After the process is complete, only a wish spell can reverse the effect.</p>',

      "<p>When sorrow distresses eladrin, they enter the winter season, becoming figures of melancholy and bitterness. Frozen tears drop from their cheeks, and their palpable sadness emanates from them as bitter cold. Eladrin dwell in the verdant splendor of the Feywild. They are related to the elves found on the Material Plane, and resemble them in both their love of beauty and the value they place on personal freedom. But where other elves can temper their wild impulses, eladrin are creatures ruled by emotion—and because of their unique magical nature, they undergo physical changes to match their changes in temperament. The eladrin have spent centuries in the Feywild, and most of them have become fey creatures as a result. Some of them are still humanoid, similar in that respect to their other elven kin. The eladrin presented here are of the fey variety. Creatures of Passion. The magic flowing through eladrin responds to their emotional state by transforming them into different seasonal aspects, with behaviors and capabilities that change with their forms. Some eladrin might remain in a particular aspect for years, while others run through the emotional spectrum each week. Lovers of Beauty. Regardless of the aspect they express, eladrin love beauty and surround themselves with lovely things. Eladrin try to possess any objects they find striking. They might seek to own a painting, a statue, or a glittering jewel. When they encounter people of comely form or luminous spirit, they use their magic to delight those folk or, in the case of evil eladrin, to abduct them. Changeable Nature. Whenever one of the eladrin presented here finishes a long rest, it can associate itself with a different season, provided it isn't incapacitated. When the eladrin makes this change, it uses the stat block of the new season, rather than its old stat block. Any damage the eladrin sustained in its original form applies to the new form, as do any conditions or other ongoing effects affecting it.</p>",

      "<p>A wood woad is a powerful plant in humanoid form invested with the soul of someone who gave up life to become an eternal guardian. Born of Sacrifice. The ritual to create a wood woad is a primeval secret passed down through generations of savage societies and dark druid circles. Performing the ritual isn't necessarily an act of evil, if the victim-to-be has entered into a bargain that requires it to be a willing sacrifice. In the ritual a living person's chest is pierced and the heart removed. A seed is then pushed into the heart, and it is placed in a tree. Any hollow or crook will do, but often a special cavity is carved out of the trunk. The tree is then bathed and watered with the blood of the sacrificed victim, and the body is buried among the tree's roots. After three days, a sprout emerges from the ground at the base of the tree and swiftly grows into a humanoid form. This new body, armored in tough bark and bearing a gnarled club and shield, is at once ready to perform its duty. The one who performed the ritual sets the wood woad to its task, and the creature follows those orders unceasingly. Pitiless Protectors. A wood woad has a hole where its heart would be, just as does the body of its former self, buried in the earth. Those who become wood woads trade their free will and all sense of sentiment for supernatural strength and a deathless duty. They exist only to protect woodlands and the people who tend them. A wood woad's face is void and expressionless, except for the motes of light that swim about in its eye sockets. Wood woads speak little, and when not being called upon to take action, they root themselves in the earth and silently take sustenance from it. Uprooted by Immortality. Like a tree, a wood woad needs only sunlight, air, and nutrients from the earth to go on living. Because they are undying, some wood woads outlive their original purpose. The site a wood woad guards might lose its power or significance over time, or those whom it was assigned to guard might themselves die. If it is freed from its specific duties, a wood woad might roam to find another place of natural beauty or fey influence to watch over. Wood woads are drawn to creatures that have close ties to nature, and that protect and respect the land, such as druids and treants. Some treants have wood woad servants by virtue of age-old pacts with druids or fey that performed the rituals, while others acquire the services of freed wood woads that find renewed purpose in the domain of a kindred guardian.</p>",

A worker robot's voice is often utilitarian, programmed to use simple phrases without embellishment. Worker robots designed to be in public view—such as units that carry out deliveries, repairs, or transportation—have voices that more closely mimic those of their creators. These robots employ mollifying phrases or make shallow but pleasant small talk. Robots are Constructs created for heavy labor, menial tasks, or routine security. Despite robots' hardy construction, their circuitry is prone to overload if exposed to strong electrical currents. A robot has a pair of small appendages for fine motor control and object manipulation, as well as two larger appendages specialized for its role. Robots are programmed with intelligence, understanding, and usually loyalty to their creators. Despite that, long-operating robots sometimes develop their own personalities and ideas. Robots that endure long stretches of isolation, mistreatment, or neglect are prone to malfunctions.

Although they are entrusted with leading lesser yugoloths, yagnoloths ultimately take their orders from arcanaloths and ultroloths. Aside from their superiors, yagnoloths have full authority over and expect obedience from the fiends under their command. A yagnoloth follows the dictates in a contract it negotiated, but it is certain to have included a loophole to escape its obligation if the situation warrants. A yagnoloth has one arm of human size and one giant-sized arm, and it always covers one or the other with a long cape. During negotiations, the yagnoloth uncovers its human arm and uses it to draft and sign contracts. When a show of force is necessary or when combat is joined, it shifts its cape to reveal its brutally powerful giant appendage. Mercenaries that ply their trade throughout the Lower Planes and in other realms, yugoloths have a reputation for effectiveness that is matched only by their desire for ever more wealth. Although yugoloths aren't especially loyal and typically try to exploit every potential loophole in a contract, they undertake any task for which they are hired, no matter how despicable. Yugoloths come in a wide variety of forms, including those described in the Monster Manual and the six creatures presented here.</p>",

    description:
      "<p>A zodar is a bipedal entity whose body is encased in an obsidian exoskeleton. It has no facial features aside from two narrow, vertical slits that resemble eyes, and its countenance betrays no hint of pain or emotion. Underneath its armored exterior, a zodar's body is composed of tightly knit muscle fibers that make it incredibly strong and heavy. A zodar weighs 1,500 pounds. No one knows how many zodars exist or where they came from, but the most popular hypothesis is that they are the creations of some long-forgotten god. Zodars interact with other sapient creatures in a manner that goes beyond mere aloofness. They simply hover in silence. When a zodar finally performs some significant action, the reasons for that action aren't always clear. One interpretation of this behavior posits that each zodar has a specific mission and is relentless in its pursuit of the goal, but it reacts oddly to situations that don't involve its mission because it doesn't know what else to do. Another theory is that all zodars are working in concert to achieve some master objective. A third, less ominous idea is that zodars lost their sense of purpose when their creator vanished, and they are struggling to find their new role. A zodar can cause speech to issue from the air around it on three occasions in its lifetime. When it feels compelled to speak, it chooses its words wisely. It can also warp the fabric of the multiverse to cast the wish spell as its final act—it is destroyed once the spell is cast.</p>",

It leaves behind a shimmering trail that quickly solidifies into a thin layer of a nearly transparent substance inedible to the snail. This glassy residue can be harvested and cut to form window panes of varying clearness. It can also be heated and spun into glass objects of other sorts. Some humanoids make a living from trailing flail snails to collect this glass.</p>",

Horrors. Terrifying evils stalk, fly, and scuttle in the dark corners of Ravnica, from the depths of the undercity to the blackest parts of the night sky. Collectively, these creatures are called horrors—a variety of things that lurk in the dark and embody the deepest fears of Ravnica's people. All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning. At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory. House Dimir uses all three base kinds of horrors. The Cult of Rakdos prefers shadow horrors, and the Golgari Swarm uses skittering horrors. Customizing a Horror. Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.</p>",

The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation. The Spawning Stone. Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason. The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them. Birth and Transformation. Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories. Shapechangers. Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.</p>",

      "<p>A solar dragon (also known as a radiant dragon or a sun dragon) is born in the heart of a star. It divides its time outside its lair between patrolling its territory and hunting for food. The dragon has a serpentine body, a pair of ventral limbs ending in long fins, nebulous wings that give off light, and gleaming, multicolored scales. It can see clearly even in blindingly bright light. Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders. Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting ground. They tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs. A solar dragon egg has an obsidian shell, shiny black and opaque. When an egg is close to hatching, the shell becomes translucent, allowing the light from the unborn wyrmling's wings to shine through.</p>",

      '<p>Space clowns are the inhabitants of a Wildspace system known as Clownspace. The humans who once inhabited the system\'s three ring-shaped worlds placed their faith in a god of revelry. Their worship ceremonies were centered on festivals and frivolity. Over time, the people\'s happiness hinged on the ever-increasing consumption of an elixir called Thrill Joy. Only after they became addicted did they discover that the priests of their faith had distilled the elixir from demonic ichor and the nectar of the bozo flower. Eventually, Thrill Joy transformed the faithful into fiendish creatures and "blessed" them with clown-like appearances. Space clowns acquired their first spelljamming helms from dohwar merchants (see "Dohwar"). Subsequent visits to other Wildspace systems led to contact with a multitude of other folk. In the wake of these encounters, love and fear of clowns has spread to all corners of the multiverse, just as the space clowns have done themselves. Marauding space clowns feed on Humanoid flesh. They travel through space in garishly decorated ships and sometimes take up residence on populated worlds, where they set up carnival tents to lure curious onlookers into their clutches. They are armed with colorfully painted ray guns that work only for them; these toys are harmless in the hands of anyone else.</p>',

The creatures aren't as powerful as their black dragon progenitors, though, and they often drain the enclaves' resources with their selfish demands.

    description:
      "<p>Smaller than most other devils, spinagons act as messengers and spies for greater devils and archdevils. They are the eyes and ears of the Nine Hells, and even fiends that despise a spined devil's weakness treat it with a modicum of respect. A spined devil's body and tail bristle with spines, and it can fling its tail spines as ranged weapons. The spines burst into flame on impact. When not delivering messages or gathering intelligence, spined devils serve in the infernal legions as flying artillery, making up for their relative weakness by mobbing together to overwhelm their foes. Though they crave promotion and power, spined devils are craven by nature, and they will quickly scatter if a fight goes against them. Devils. Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned. Lords of Tyranny. Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power. Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions. Obedience and Ambition. In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss. At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia. Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers. Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells. To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. The Infernal Hierarchy. The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates. A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes. If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears. Archdevils. The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells, as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature. Greater Devils. The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils. Lesser Devils. The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils. Lemures. The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life. Promotion and Demotion. When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next. Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms. Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive. No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires. The Nine Hells. The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers. The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one. Devil True Names and Talismans. Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils. A mortal who learns a devil's true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted. However it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner's soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.</p>",

Sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering inherent to the shadowy landscape and visit horror on those who stumble into their midst. Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress.</p>",

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.</p><p>Flyby. The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach. The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</p><p>Mimicry. Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon. The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p><p>Rejuvenation. You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery. If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.</p><p>Special Senses. Most dragons have blindsight and darkvision. You might upgrade blindsight to truesight, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed tremorsense.</p><p>Tunneler. The dragon can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a tunnel in its wake.</p><p>VARIANT: DRAGONS AS INNATE SPELLCASTERS. This dragon can innately cast ten spells, once per day each, requiring no material components. Each spell's level can be no higher than 9th. The dragon's spell save DC is DC 26, and it has +18 to hit with spell attacks. A suggested spell list is shown below, but you can also choose spells to reflect the dragon's character. A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells. You can also give a dragon spells of a higher level than this rule allows, but such a tweak might increase the dragon's challenge rating—especially if those spells deal damage or impose conditions on targets. beacon of hope calm emotions hold person polymorph teleport zone of truth. Dragons are innately magical creatures that can master a few spells as they age, using this variant. A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell's level can be no higher than one-third the dragon's challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon's bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon's spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma modifier. This dragon can innately cast ten spells, once per day each, requiring no material components. Each spell's level can be no higher than 9th. The dragon's spell save DC is DC 26, and it has +18 to hit with spell attacks. See the spell page for a list of spells the dragon is capable of casting. A selection of examples are shown below: Otiluke's freezing sphere prismatic spray wall of ice contingency arcane gate.</p>",

      '<p>Some of the oldest and wisest metallic dragons undergo a miraculous metamorphosis to become greatwyrms. This transformation is often wrought by Bahamut, who takes pride in elevating his worthiest children to a status approaching his own greatness.</p><p>A metallic greatwyrm\'s transformation often involves fusing the consciousness, the magic, and sometimes even the physical forms of multiple echoes of the same dragon across the worlds of the Material Plane. Several of the dragons identified as dragon gods—including Aasterinian (described in the "Brass Dragons" section of chapter 5), Lendys, and Tamara—are metallic greatwyrms who have combined the essences of multiple forms to achieve this godlike status.</p><p>Metallic greatwyrms are among the largest creatures in the multiverse, overshadowing most other dragons. Mighty elemental forces swirl around them in response to their wishes, and their breath weapons can sap the strength from armies—or lay waste to whole regions.</p><p>Lendys and Tamara are both silver greatwyrms, but they could not be more different from each other. Lendys is renowned as an impartial judge who is equally ready to serve as jury and executioner when dragons commit grave injustices against dragonkind. He is lawful neutral, and he is said to be incapable of mercy or forgiveness. Tamara, by contrast, embodies the ideal of mercy. She heals the sick, tends the injured, and delivers a peaceful departure to dragons nearing the end of their natural lives. She has a particular loathing for dracoliches and other draconic Undead.</p>',

As a demon lord who has chosen to live in Ravnica, Rakdos claims authority over all the demons of this world-even if some of them, ambitious and headstrong as demons are, rebel against his authority. Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts of terror in plain sight under the auspices of the Cult of Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic performances that leave the audience members blood-soaked but ecstatic. They incite mob riots that raze entire city blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself, who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged. Demonic \"Devils\" The creatures called \"devils\" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to quasits. While the larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult.

Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, and—true to its name—the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind.

      "<p>A slumbering scion of Grolantor is often mistaken for a hill, and sometimes people erect standing stones, a village, or a city on a scion's back, unaware of the mighty power beneath them. Such settlements can thrive for centuries, as the scion's magic causes crops to flourish and livestock to thrive in the surrounding region. An ancient tree towers from the crest of the hill. When roused, a cradle of the hill scion rises as a mass of dirt, stone, and roots with two massive arms. The cradle uses tree roots and waves of dirt to entangle and entomb foes. If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Grolantor inside it awakens. Standing 50 feet tall, the scion devours everything within reach to satiate its hunger. Its powerful lungs can suck food straight into its gullet. The scion uses a great tree to bat foes far into the distance.</p><p>Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.</p>",

      "<p>A slumbering scion of Memnor appears as a dense, slowly drifting tower of clouds that never dissipates. Often, this cloud lingers over a remote valley, creating a constantly overcast sky. Sapient creatures who live beneath this cloud often display superstitious and duplicitous behavior, almost unconsciously leaving gifts for \"rain spirits\" while playing mischievous pranks on each other. When roused, a cradle of the cloud scion manifests as a titanic air elemental made of fierce winds and wisps of cloud. It wields air and thunder to knock enemies from the sky. If the cradle is destroyed, the scion of Memnor emerges from the dissipating cloud, often laughing as if it just heard a great joke. Incredibly tall and lanky, the scion towers 75 feet tall and wields a morningstar made from magically dense clouds. It tends to regard other creatures as toys rather than serious threats, and it uses its illusion magic to manipulate creatures into fighting each other. If seriously threatened, it wields thunder and wind to demolish its enemies.</p><p>Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children.

It often finds some relief in waking and being freed from its troubling dreams, so it doesn't necessarily lash out in violence when emerging from its cradle. But it's not particularly interested in Humanoids or other little creatures—either in conversing with them or in protecting them from harm it might cause.

      "<p>A slumbering scion of Thrym encased in its cradle is functionally identical to a glacier or iceberg, nestled in an alpine valley or drifting in a polar sea. In its wintry seclusion, the scion dreams of battle and glory. If it is disturbed, the scion's cradle animates as a bipedal figure formed of ice and snow. It smashes intruders with its icy fists or hurls shards of its own icy substance at them, and it can exhale a blast of frigid air to freeze foes in place. If the cradle is destroyed, its icy body shatters to reveal the awakened scion of Thrym inside it. Forming a double-bladed axe in its hand, the 70-foot-tall scion rushes at any foe that dares to challenge it. Emulating sagas of Thrym, the scion can achieve a tremendous feat of strength: creating a glacier in the ground and hurling it skyward, along with any creatures standing on it.</p><p>Giants are descended from the All-Father, Annam, and his children. But scions of giants' gods boast a greater claim: they are Annam's grandchildren, and they occupy a privileged place among giants. On some worlds, these scions ruled the first empires of giants until Annam retreated into seclusion. On other worlds, the scions guard their birthplaces (which are rich in elemental magic) or hold the substance of the world together. Scions of giants' gods are enormously powerful beings who infuse the world around them with primeval magic. In many worlds, they slumber and have become part of the landscape. In this case, each scion is enclosed in stasis inside a powerful Elemental called a cradle. The cradle protects the slumbering scion and follows its subconscious wishes, including driving off intruders. But if the cradle dies, the scion within fully awakens.</p>",

      "<p>Those who have fought shadow dancers describe the experience as similar to fighting a living darkness. Every dim alcove and darkened nook is a place the lithe and acrobatic shadow dancers can emerge from to ambush their prey. Using this tactic, they attack their enemies from all angles with a flurry of entangling chains that hold fast and corrupt the flesh. When their quarry is helpless, they dispatch it and then loot the corpse for trinkets, particularly anything colorful and lively to gaze at after they return to the gloom of the Shadowfell.</p><p>In the gloom of the Shadowfell live shadar-kai, elves whose ancestors served the Raven Queen, a god of death and memory. They were brought to that realm in ages past, so long ago that they're now adapted to its cheerless environment, both physically and mentally.</p><p>Eons of exposure to the influence of the Shadowfell has left shadar-kai often joyless and mournful. In that realm, they have pale hair, wrinkled gray skin, and swollen joints that give them a corpselike aspect. They appear more youthful while on other planes, but their skin always retains a deathly ashen hue. When in the Shadowfell, they detest mirrors and avoid keeping things that remind them of their age.</p><p>Shadar-kai of the Raven Queen watch over both the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, scouting out choice souls and tragedies that might please their deity. They are rumored to be able to coax worldly events along tragic paths for her amusement. The Raven Queen is famously cryptic even to her most devoted followers, however; their efforts are rewarded only with vague omens they interpret as best they can.</p><p>The shadar-kai who are most devoted to the Raven Queen serve her at the Fortress of Memories, her twisted castle in the Shadowfell. The fortress is a mournful place, filled with incessant echoes of the past. Flocks of ravens that act as the Raven Queen's eyes and ears darken the skies around it when they emerge from within, bearing her cryptic messages and omens far and wide across the multiverse.</p><p>Within the fortress are items that the Raven Queen finds irresistible: objects invested with deep feelings of sorrow, longing, or remorse. These items are brought to her as gifts from the shadar-kai, and include furniture, clocks, mirrors, jewels, and toys. Ghostly visions of people, places, and pets also appear in the fortress. Any of these things can spontaneously appear about her lair, every object and apparition being a metaphoric representation of some story—great or small—that was saturated with raw emotion.</p><p>Shadar-kai encountered outside the Shadowfell are often on quests to find the most sorrow-touched items they can find to bring back to their queen's gloomy castle.</p>",

      "<p>Across fog-shrouded coasts or endless ocean swells, an ominous drone sounded on a conch shell chills the blood of all who hear it. This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn-a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as \"sea devils,\" for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.</p><p><em><strong>Devils of the Deep.</strong></em> Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean's black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore. Though they dwell in the deepest trenches of the ocean, sahuagin view the entire aquatic realm as their kingdom and the creatures in it as blood sport for their hunting parties. The self-styled rulers of sahuagin ocean domains are massive mutant males that grow second sets of arms. They are terrible foes in battle, and all sahuagin bow down before these powerful barons.</p><p><em><strong>Way of the Shark.</strong></em> Sahuagin worship the shark god Sekolah. Only female sahuagin are deemed worthy of channeling the god's power, and priestesses hold tremendous sway in sahuagin communities. Sahuagin are driven into a frenzy by the smell of fresh blood. As worshipers of Sekolah, they also have a special kinship with sharks, which they train as attack animals. Even untrained sharks recognize sahuagin as allies and don't prey on them.</p><p><em><strong>Elven Enmity.</strong></em> The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict. So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti—a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way. Sahuagin are prone to mutation, but whether this rare phenomenon is a result of the wars between the sahuagin and the aquatic elves-or whether it preceded or even began the conflict-none can say. The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin. The mere shadow of the malenti threat incites paranoia and suspicion among aquatic elves, whose resilience is weakened as the prelude to an actual sahuagin invasion.</p>",

They return from the sea as humans, but when they reach old age, they transform into sea spawn and rejoin their master in the dark depths. Some children return having suffered partial transformations, leaving them semi-bestial until their full transformation when they reach old age.

Redcaps, although small, have formidable strength, which they use to hunt and kill without hesitation or regret.</p><p>In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground.

When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.</p><p>Redcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.</p><p>To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn't replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been.

A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature's murderous handiwork.</p><p>In any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims.

He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.</p><p>The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight.

Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.</p><p>Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned.

    description:
      "<p>Hill giants are selfish, dimwitted brutes that hunt, forage, and raid in constant search of food. They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength. They dwell in hills and mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud-and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs. In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power. Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud. Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too. The hill giants' ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped. With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter. In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one another's shoulders holding a giant-painted pumpkin-head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them. A hill giant that feels as though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry. If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny. Its decisions shift with its mood, and if it forgets the title it bestowed upon itself, it might eat its subjects on a whim.</p>",

When howlers go on the prowl, courage isn't enough to stand up against them, and even one's sanity is at risk. These nightmare creatures, native to Pandemonium, can also be found on most of the Lower Planes, because of the many fiends that capture them and train them as war hounds. Howlers can be domesticated, after a fashion, but they respond only to brutal training during which they are forced to recognize the trainer as the pack's undisputed leader. A trained pack then follows its leader without hesitation. Howler packs course over the battlefields of the Blood War and also serve evil mortals who have the power and the savagery to command their loyalty. Howlers rely on speed, numbers, and their mind-numbing howl to corner prey before they tear it apart. The howl floods the minds of its victims, making complex thought impossible. They can do little more than stare in horror and stumble around the battlefield in a search for safety. Any task more demanding than that is beyond their capability. Fiends especially prize howlers for this reason, because for a few crucial moments in a battle, their howls can neutralize an enemy's ability to use spells and other powers.</p>",

In truth it makes their bodies so desperate for sustenance that they become susceptible to indoctrination.

Although he has enough power to challenge the lord of Cania, he has never wavered in his support for his master, suggesting Mephistopheles has some hold over him. Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure figure, known only to the most learned infernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few in number. He hates mortals, and when summoned from the Hells, he repays the instigator with a long and agonizing death. Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many forays into the Material Plane, as his absence leaves him vulnerable to rivals. Other archdevils secretly disseminate the means to call him from the Nine Hells, hoping to distract him long enough to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from his post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been struck, Hutijin repays the interruption with death.</p>",

      "<p>Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways. Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.</p>",
    description:
      "<p>Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts. A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life. Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will. A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes. The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul. The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.</p>",

These creatures can hurt the body and also attack the minds of dreamers afflicted by the Wicked Slumber. During the Phyrexian invasion of Eldraine, the high fae monarch Talion, the Kindly Lord, and a trio of witch sisters performed a grand ritual to create a sleeping curse. Even with the Phyrexians defeated, the curse remains and spreads unchecked through Eldraine due to interference from the planeswalker Ashiok and Eriette, one of the witches who helped create the curse. The Wicked Slumber affects rich and poor alike, causing them to fall into an endless sleep or roam as sleepwalkers. Animals are also affected, and even tree boughs droop as if exhausted in areas where the Wicked Slumber is prominent. Purple tendrils of wispy nightmares spread like vines across those areas and surround the bodies of those who sleep. Heroes throughout Eldraine have ventured out to find a cure for the Wicked Slumber, but no one has yet discovered how to break the enchantment. It has even affected one of the Kindly Lord's daughters, the famed duelist Obyra. Meanwhile, Eriette and Ashiok conspire to build a nightmare realm in the ruins of Castle Ardenvale at the heart of the Wicked Slumber, replacing the virtuous court with one composed of sleepwalkers and dreamers guarded by nightmare haunts.</p>",

      "<p>\"Evil lurks everywhere. With our minds, we will unearth it, we will plumb its depths, and we will annihilate it.\" With those words, the psychically gifted priest Ulmed founded the Ulmist Inquisition, an order of psionic inquisitors that seeks to discover the wickedness hiding in people's souls. In the days before Count Strahd von Zarovich became the first vampire, Strahd thundered across the lands with Ulmed. Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person. Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire—their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome. Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals. The zeal of the inquisitors in this work has caused them to be a source of terror in many communities, where folk fear that an overzealous inquisitor might be as great a monster as the fiends the inquisitors originally hunted.</p>",

The clockwork has resistance to force, lightning, and thunder damage.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Self-Repairing. If the clockwork starts its turn with at least 1 hit point, it regains 5 hit points. If it takes lightning damage, this ability doesn't function at the start of its next turn.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Sturdy Frame. The clockwork's hit point maximum increases by an amount equal to its number of Hit Dice.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Suction. The clockwork gains a climbing speed of 30 feet.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Vocal Resonator.

Artificers and wizards are responsible for most of the homunculi in existence. Each kind of homunculus has a body constructed from different kinds of materials, including clay, iron, and bits of hair and feathers. The process that creates a homunculus sees those materials mixed with the creator's blood and animated through an extended magical ritual.</p>",

Most ironscale hydras inhabit lakes and boggy caverns, from which they hunt unwary creatures that come for a drink or swim. What krakens are to the sea and dragons are to the sky, hydras are to the lands of Theros. Various hydras dwell at the fringes of civilization, from the bog-dwelling hydras known across the multiverse to massive ironscale hydras that lurk in deep wildernesses. Beyond even these exist serpentine horrors born of the whims of foul gods, like the legendary hydra Polukranos.</p>",
