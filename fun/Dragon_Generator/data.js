At the heart of the world (underground, or in a remote area of pristine wilderness) stands a tree on which dragon eggs grow like fruit. Once in a lifetime, each dragon feels an overwhelming urge to seek out this tree. After finding it, the dragon must persuade its guardian to relinquish one or more eggs.', 'Consuming Treasure. By eating a significant portion of their own hoards, dragons cause themselves to lay clutches of eggs.', 'Magical Crafting. Mirroring the creative acts of Bahamut and Tiamat, dragons craft their eggs through painstaking labor, then breathe the gift of life into them.', 'Draconic Transformation. Enlightened non-dragons (most often Humanoids) are transformed into dragon eggs when they die, when they experience profound enlightenment, or when they undergo a ritual that might involve bathing in dragon blood or being devoured by a dragon. Humanoids and dragons alike understand the transformation to be a transition into a higher state of existence.', 'Divine Origin. Only Bahamut and Tiamat can create dragon eggs—each egg is the result of divine intervention.', 'Spontaneous Formation. Dragon eggs arise naturally in certain regions, often in underground veins of metal ore or gems for metallic and gem dragons, respectively, or in extreme environments (volcanoes, arctic wastes, deadly swamps, and so forth) for chromatic dragons. The eggs might hatch on their own, or they might have to be unearthed first by another creature, whether that’s an adult or older dragon or a hapless miner.', 'Parthenogenesis. An adult or older dragon can lay a clutch of eggs whenever the dragon feels ready to rear a clutch of wyrmlings—or to impose that responsibility on others.', 'Dragon Conclave. Five adult or older dragons of different kinds come together to create a clutch of eggs, with each giving up a bit of life energy as part of the process.

The characters must prevent the dragon from summoning aid or face a new threat.', 'The dragon is desperately trying to protect a particular treasure, one or more eggs, or perhaps a minion, bargaining to protect this treasure and flying into a rage if it is harmed.', 'The previous occupant of the dragon’s lair left behind a curse, a trap, or a lingering spirit that clever characters can turn against the dragon.', 'The dragon’s lair is almost impossible to navigate without access to one or more of the dragon’s special movement modes (typically flight, but possibly burrowing, swimming, or climbing).', 'It’s been so long since anyone has dared to intrude on the dragon’s lair that the dragon is more interested in showing off the lair—and impressive lair actions—than in doing serious harm to the characters.

The dragon avoids the feature unless the encounter is going badly, then either activates the feature or tries to goad the characters into doing so.', 'Spell effects and breath weapons used inside the dragon’s lair cause dramatic destruction, including chasms opening up, ceilings collapsing, pillars toppling, and other effects that can damage or hinder the characters and the dragon equally.', 'The dragon has a rival who notices the characters approaching the dragon’s lair and keeps tabs on the fight. This rival might step in to help the characters or the dragon, depending on the circumstances, or might ambush the characters when they leave the dragon’s lair.', 'The dragon takes tremendous pleasure in adopting Humanoid form and pretending to be a minion, groveling and sniveling when intruders enter the lair and claiming that the dragon is away.', 'The dragon’s only goal is to learn a key piece of information about the characters’ larger goals and then escape.', 'The dragon enjoys combat, roaring in appreciation each time the characters pull off effective attacks or flashy spells. But if seriously hurt, the dragon quickly calls for a truce.', 'Each round of combat with the dragon, the characters catch an eerie glimpse of another world where one of the dragon’s echoes is active.', 'The dragon has a plan to feign death in case of attack—apparently being buried in a cave-in, tumbling into a deep chasm, drowning in lava, or some similarly dramatic exit. After escaping, the dragon plots revenge.', 'At the same time the characters are confronting the dragon, another group of adventurers is confronting one of the dragon’s echoes on another world.
