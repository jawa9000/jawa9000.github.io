Any sinkholes remain where they are.</p><p><strong>Additional Regional Effects</strong></p><p>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:</p><p><strong>Blue Luster</strong>. Creatures that spend a year within 1 mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.</p><p><strong>Mirage Terrain</strong>. The area immediately surrounding the lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.</p><p><strong>Sandstorm</strong>. A sandstorm blows constantly within 1 mile of the lair.</p>",
    "notes": "<p><strong>Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</strong></p><p>This dragon can innately cast three spells, once per day each, requiring no material components. Each spell's level can be no higher than 4th. The dragon's spell save DC is DC 19, and it has +9 to hit with spell attacks.</p><p>A suggested spell list is shown below, but you can also choose spells to reflect the dragon's character. A dragon who innately casts druid spells feels different from one who casts warlock spells. You can also give a dragon spells of a higher level than this rule allows, but such a tweak might increase the dragon's challenge rating—especially if those spells deal damage or impose conditions on targets.</p><p><ul><li>lightning bolt</li><li>thunderwave</li><li>gust of wind</li></ul></p>",

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</li><li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li><li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Additional Lair Actions</strong></p><p>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p><p><strong>Blinding Sleet.</strong> Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><p><strong>Whirling Wind.</strong> A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.</p>",

Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.</li><li>If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li></ul></p><p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p><p><strong>Additional Regional Effects</strong></p><p>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:</p><p><strong>Biting Chill</strong>. Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.</p><p><strong>Mirror Ice</strong>. The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Ancient black dragons are the most cunning and intelligent of all chromatic dragons. They are also the most sadistic, taking pleasure in the suffering of others.

They are able to breathe a cone of acid that can melt through even the toughest armor, and they can also create pools of acid that can trap and destroy their enemies.</p><p>In addition to their magical abilities, ancient black dragons are also formidable physical combatants. They have powerful jaws and claws that can tear through flesh and bone, and they are able to fly at incredible speeds, making them difficult to catch or evade.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands. Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon’s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon’s first line of defense. A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions — along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>",

The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.</li><li>Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li><li>The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Additional Lair Actions</strong></p><p>At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) white dragon can use one or both of the following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p><p><strong>Blinding Sleet.</strong> Driving sleet falls in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot-radius cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p><p><strong>Whirling Wind.</strong> A strong wind blows in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on strong wind). The dragon's flying is not affected by this wind, which lasts until the next time the dragon uses a lair action or until the dragon dies.</p>",
    "regional effects": "<p>The region containing a legendary white dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p><ul><li>Chilly fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li><li>Freezing precipitation falls within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, sometimes forming blizzard conditions when the dragon is at rest.</li><li>Icy walls block off areas in the dragon's lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage.</li><li>If the dragon wishes to move through a wall, it can do so without slowing down. The portion of the wall the dragon moves through is destroyed, however.</li></ul></p><p>If the dragon dies, the fog and precipitation fade within 1 day. The ice walls melt over the course of 1d10 days.</p><p><strong>Additional Regional Effects</strong></p><p>Any of these effects might appear in the area around a white dragon's lair, in addition to or instead of the effects described in the Monster Manual:</p><p><strong>Biting Chill</strong>. Extreme cold envelops the land within 6 miles of the dragon's lair (see the Dungeon Master's Guide for rules on extreme cold). If the climate in the area already features extreme cold, the cold is numbing, giving creatures in the area without immunity or resistance to cold damage disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity checks.</p><p><strong>Mirror Ice</strong>. The icy surfaces in the dragon's lair reflect light like mirrors, giving creatures in the lair other than the dragon disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage, any creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a different direction from the direction it intends.</p>",

    "description": "Dragon turtles are among the most fearsome creatures of the oceans. As large and voracious as the oldest of its land-based dragon kin, a dragon turtle strikes with its deadly jaws, steaming breath, and crushing tail.</p><p>A dragon turtle's rough shell is the same dark green color as the deep water where this monster dwells. Silver highlights lining the shell resemble light dancing on open water, and a surfacing dragon turtle is sometimes mistaken for the reflection of the sun or moon on the waves.</p><p><strong>Dragons of the Deep</strong>. Like true dragons, dragon turtles collect treasure, first by sinking ships and then by sifting through the wreckage for coins and other precious items. A dragon turtle swallows treasure for transport, then regurgitates it when it reaches its lair.</p><p>Dragon turtles dwell in caves hidden in coral reefs or beneath the seafloor, or along rugged stretches of coastline. If a choice cave is already inhabited, a dragon turtle attacks its current residents in an attempt to take over.</p><p><strong>Mercenary Monsters</strong>. A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.</p><p><strong>Elemental Might</strong>. Dragon turtles sometimes find their way through sunken planar rifts to the Elemental Plane of Water. Those monstrous specimens can often be found in the service of marids, which strap magnificent coral thrones to the backs of dragon turtles and ride them as mounts.</p>"

For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.</p><p><em><strong>Invisible Passage.</strong></em> The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</p>",

    "liar action": "<p>The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.</p><p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p><p><ul><li>Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.</li><li>The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.</li></ul></p><p>A powerful green hag might have the following additional lair action:</p><p><ul><li>The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its possession.</li></ul></p>",
    "regional effects": "<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.</p><p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p><ul><li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li><li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li><li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.</li></ul></p><p>A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p><p><ul><li>Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.</li><li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li><li>Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Hag Covens</strong></p><p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</p><p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</p><p><em><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong></em>. While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:</p><p><ul><li>1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</li><li>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</li><li>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</li><li>4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</li><li>5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</li><li>6th level (1 slot): eyebite</li></ul></p><p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.</p><p><strong>Hag Eye</strong>. A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p><p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</p>"

The dancing creature is incapacitated and must use all its movement to dance.</p><p><strong>Disorienting Visions</strong>. Disorienting illusory images flit through the dragon's lair.

    "regional effects": "<p>The region surrounding a legendary moonstone dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:</p><p><strong>Dream Communication</strong>. Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.</p><p><strong>Planar Transition</strong>. The veil between planes is thinned near a moonstone dragon's lair. Various portals link the Material Plane, the Feywild, and the Border Ethereal within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures can pass through a portal in either direction by spending 5 feet of movement.</p><p><strong>Portal Closure</strong>. If the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points, the portals near its lair close immediately, and the planar transition effect ends.</p><p>These effects last until the dragon dies or moves more than 6 miles from its lair.</p><p><strong>Customizing Dragons</strong></p><p>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.</p><p><strong>Languages</strong>. Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.</p><p><strong>Skills</strong>. Most dragons are proficient in the Perception and Stealth skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.</p><p><em><strong>Other Traits and Actions</strong></em>. You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:</p><p><strong>Flyby. The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.</p><p><strong>The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.</p><p><strong>Mimicry. Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.</p><p><strong>The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p><p><strong>Rejuvenation. You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery. If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.</p><p><strong>Special Senses</strong>. Most dragons have blindsight and darkvision. You might upgrade blindsight to truesight, or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed tremorsense.</p>",

While holding the staff, she can cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these spells are marked with an asterisk).

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature that enters the blizzard for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.</p>",
    "regional effects": "<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders. Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10 days to fade away.</p><p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p><p><ul><li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li><li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li><li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically appear in trees.</li></ul></p><p>A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p><p><ul><li>Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any damage, it disappears.</li><li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking mud.</li><li>Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile intruders are near.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Hag Covens</strong></p><p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.</p><p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.</p><p><em><strong>Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)</strong></em>. While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:</p><p><ul><li>1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</li><li>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</li><li>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</li><li>4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</li><li>5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</li><li>6th level (1 slot): eyebite</li></ul></p><p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier.</p><p><strong>Hag Eye</strong>. A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p><p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.</p>"

Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.

Such genies can innately cast the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell.

Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.</p><p><em><strong>Wishes</strong></em>. The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence. To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.</p>",

The skull isn't visible while the stone cursed is active, but when it is slain, the statue shatters and the skull clatters to the ground. Because it is the nexus for the alchemy used to create these horrors, a dim echo of the original victim's memories resonates within the skull.

Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet it in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.</p><p>Vaprak's Blessing. After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next.</p>"

Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.

    traits: "<p><em><strong>Shapechanger.</strong></em> If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In either case, if air can pass through a space, the mist can. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it can't be grappled, prone, pushed, restrained, or stunned. It takes no damage from nonmagical attacks. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p><p><em><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong></em> If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p><p><em><strong>Misty Escape.</strong></em> When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its true form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it regains 1 hit point.</p><p><em><strong>Regeneration.</strong></em> The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</p><p><em><strong>Spider Climb.</strong></em> The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.</p><p><em><strong>Vampire Weaknesses.</strong></em> The vampire has the following flaws:<ul><li>Forbiddance: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.</li><li>Harmed by Running Water: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.</li><li>Stake to the Heart: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while it is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.</li><li>Sunlight Hypersensitivity: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight.

    "description": "<p>Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces. Dark Desires. Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed. Born from Death. Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies. Chained to the Grave. Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way. Undead Nature. Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air. A Vampire's Lair. A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night. PLAYER CHARACTERS AS VAMPIRES The game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Granted by powerful fey to individuals who please them, yeth hounds serve evil masters like hunting dogs. Yeth hounds fly in pursuit of their prey, often waiting until it is too exhausted to fight back. Only the threat of dawn drives the pack back into hiding. Minions of a Dark Master. A pack of yeth hounds can be created by powerful fey such as the Queen of Air and Darkness. Once it is brought into existence, a pack must have a master, who is often someone the creator wishes to reward. The master can telepathically communicate with its yeth hounds to give them commands from afar. If the master of a pack is killed, the hounds seek and choose a new master, typically an individual of great evil such as a vampire, a necromancer, or a hag. A yeth hound stands about 5 feet tall at the shoulder and weighs around 400 pounds. Often all that can be seen of one in the darkness is the red glow of its eyes against its night-black fur. The head of a yeth hound has a human-like face, held up by a neck more flexible than a dog's. The creature gives off an odor like smoke. Sound of Looming Death. Yeth hounds make a ghastly baying sound that can be heard all around. Creatures that can see a hound when it bays are filled with supernatural fear and usually flee in terror. When a victim tries to run away, a hound delights in chasing after it and tormenting it before bringing the hunt to a close.</p><p>Those that stand their ground and fight back discover that mundane weapons partially pass through the hound as if it was made of fog, but magic weapons and silvered weapons can strike true.</p><p>Foiled by Sunlight. Yeth hounds can't stand sunlight. A pack never willingly prolongs a hunt beyond the night hours and always seeks to return to its dark den before the first rays of dawn. No amount of coercion by a pack's master can deter this behavior. If a yeth hound is exposed to natural sunlight, it fades away, vanishing into the Ethereal Plane, from where its master can retrieve it only after the sun has set.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Zariel. Zariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane's corrupting influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the Nine Hells. All who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say over who comes and goes. Given her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of it. However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a result, Zariel's servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.</p><p>Zariel's Lair. Zariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams and moans coming from the burned victims chained to the stronghold's wall, the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.</p>"

Utterly inhuman, Zuggtmoy can mold her fungoid form into an approximation of a humanoid shape, including the skeletal-thin figure depicted in grimoires and ancient art, draped and veiled in mycelia and lichen. Indeed, much of her appearance and manner, and that of her servants, is a soulless mockery of mortal life and its many facets. Zuggtmoy's cultists often follow her unwittingly. Most are fungi-infected to some degree, whether through inhaling her mind-controlling spores or being transformed to the point where flesh and fungus become one. Such cultists are fungal extensions of the Demon Queen's will. Their devotion might begin with the seemingly harmless promises offered by exotic spores and mushrooms, but quickly consumes them, body and soul.</p><p>Zuggtmoy's Lair. Zuggtmoy's principal lair is her palace on Shedaklah. It consists of two dozen mushrooms of pale yellow and rancid brown. These massive fungi are some of the largest in existence.

The mushrooms themselves are all interconnected by bridges of shelf-fungi, and countless chambers have been hollowed out from within their rubbery, fibrous stalks.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Deathpact angels dwell in the grandest of Orzhov cathedrals, where they surround themselves with wealth and wretched vassals that are utterly in their thrall. Posing as a beneficent god, a deathpact angel attracts petitioners who beg the angel for blessings: wealth, prestige, health, revenge, and the like. Imagining itself generous and merciful, the angel usually tries to grant the petitioners what they seek by using its abilities, drawing from its hoard of riches, or extorting favors from other members of the guild. True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts. Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter). Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power. Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.</p>"

However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters. Running and breeding freely in the Feywild, the displacer beasts soon came to the attention of the Seelie Court.

    "description": "<p>Despite frequent shifts in leadership among other archdevils, Dispater has maintained his position as the ruler of Dis since its creation. Known for his vigilance and caution, he rarely leaves his tower, and even less frequently leaves the Iron City. Those who know his plans, including Asmodeus, know that he hopes to one day rule each layer of the Nine Hells. Dispater remains one of the foremost suppliers of weapons across all the planes, which helps keep his position in Dis secure. As well, his advisors are carefully chosen and he maintains very few friendships. Those that attempt battle with the Iron Lord find victory nigh impossible. In addition to his stratagem and defense, Dispater maintains extremely powerful abilities and a legion of minions. Outwitting him can't be done, and anyone unfortunate enough to catch him off guard is quickly disposed of.</p><p>Dispater remains calm and controlled in conversation. He prefers wherever possible to engage in gentlemanly debates rather than aggressive arguments. Unlike other archdevils, he almost never forces an individual into doing something, preferring to persuade or deceive instead. Fittingly, his skin is an iron-black color and his signature staff, wrought from the same iron as the tower he lives in, is always in hand.</p>",

If the creature is harmed by Flesh to Iron again, while still partly iron, the rest of the creature also turns to iron, killing them.</p><p><strong>Call Underling (Costs 3 Actions)</strong>.

The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.</p><p><strong>Cast a Spell</strong>. The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires concentration, it lasts for the full duration instead.</p><p><strong>Deceitful Whispers</strong>. The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.</p><p><strong>Fiendish Fortitude</strong>. The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.</p><p><strong>Frenzy</strong>. The archdevil casts Haste on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.</p><p><strong>Summon Underlings</strong>. The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see.

Within 6 miles of the lair, the sound of metal working is near inescapable. Any creature attempting a short or long rest may do so, but must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw afterwards.

The tempest drowns the land beneath it with rain and stabs the earth with lances of lightning. Punishing winds scream around it as it flies, feeding the chaos it creates.</p><p>On their native planes, elementals sweep across the weird and tempestuous landscape. Some possess greater power, gained by feeding on their lesser kin and adding the essence of creatures they have devoured to their own until they become something extraordinary. When summoned, these elder elementals manifest as beings of apocalyptic capability, entities whose mere existence promises destruction.</p><p>The methods for summoning elder elementals remain hidden in forbidden tomes or inscribed on the walls of lost temples raised to honor the Elder Elemental Eye. Only casters of superlative skill have even the faintest chance of calling forth one of these monsters, and the spellcaster is often destroyed by the effort. Thus, only the most unhinged and nihilistic members of Elemental Evil cults attempt such a summoning, in the hope of hastening the world toward some cataclysmic end.</p><p>An elder elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>"

    "notes": "<p><strong>Hag Covens.</strong> When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures.  A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group.  However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.  A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third.  While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves: </p><p>1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness</p><p>2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object</p><p>3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt</p><p>4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph</p><p>5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying</p><p>6th level (1 slot): eyebite</p><p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability.  The spell save DC is 12 + the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the hag's Intelligence modifier. </p><p><strong>Hag Eye.</strong> A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item.  The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport.  A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence.  A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet.  If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours. </p><p><strong>Iron Token.</strong> An annis hag can pull out one of her iron teeth or nails and spend 1 minute shaping and polishing it into the form of a coin, a ring, or a tiny mirror.  Thereafter, any creature that holds this iron token can have a whispered conversation with the hag, provided the creature and the hag are on the same plane of existence and within 10 miles of each other.  The holder of the token can hear only the hag's voice, not those of any other creatures or any ambient noise around the hag.  Similarly, the hag can hear the holder of the token and not the noise around it.  A hag can have up to three iron tokens active at one time.  As an action, she can discern the direction and approximate distance to all of her active tokens.  She can instantaneously deactivate any of her tokens at any distance (no action required), whereupon the token retains its current form but loses its magical properties. </p>",
    "description": "<p>Annis hags lair in mountains or hills.  Despite being hunchbacked and hump-shouldered, they are the largest and most physically imposing of their kind, standing eight feet tall.  Although annis hags can easily tear a grown man apart, they love hunting children, preferring their flesh above all others.  They use the flayed skin of such victims to make supple leather, and a hag's lair often shows the signs of this industry.  Annis hags leave tokens of their cruelty at the edges of forests and other areas they claim.  In this way, they provoke fear and paranoia in nearby villages and settlements.  When an annis feels especially cruel, she disguises herself as a kindly-looking elderly woman, approaches a child in a remote place, and gives it an iron token that it can use to confide in her.  Over time, \"Granny\" convinces the child that it's okay to have bad thoughts and do bad deeds.  Much in the way that they befriend children in order to corrupt them, annis hags have a tendency for adopting a group of ogres, trolls, or other loutish creatures, ruling them through brute strength, verbal abuse, and superstition. </p>"

Ash phoenixes are the animated ashes of mass funerary pyres, which seek the eradication of all life around their birth pyres.  For an ash phoenix to be created, a group of humanoids must be burned in a mass pyre in an area tainted with necrotic energy, and the blood of a magical avian, such as an august rooster or firebird, must be mixed into the pyre as it smolders.  The creation of the ash phoenix disrupts the natural passage of souls into the afterlife, infusing the phoenix with the angry spirits.  The presence of these spirits gives the ash phoenix some level of intelligence but also drives it to seek vengeance against all living creatures.  Ash phoenixes never stray more than a few miles from their birthplace and are reborn in those same ashes each time they are slain. </p>"

They have been gliding through the astral mists since the dawn of the multiverse, trying to devour all other creatures they encounter.  As big as an ancient red dragon and covered from head to tail in layers of thick, spiked plates, a dreadnought has two gnarled limbs that end in razor-sharp pincer claws. Constellations appear to swirl in the depths of its single eye, and its serpentine, armored tail trails off into the silvery void.  An astral dreadnought lives a solitary existence. On the rare occasion when two dreadnoughts meet, they typically fight until one tires of the conflict and departs.  An astral dreadnought doesn't have a gullet or a digestive system.  Anything it swallows is deposited in a unique demiplane—an enclosed space that contains eons worth of detritus, as well as the remains of dead planar travelers.  Although it eats and sleeps if it so desires, an astral dreadnought doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. </p>"

Orcs that revere Bahgtru might tend a stable of war bulls that carry them into combat. Trained to be fierce mounts from a young age, aurochs are sacred symbols of Bahgtru. No orc will eat such creatures, which are treated as honored warriors when they perish.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Baalzebul, is an archdevil and the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. He is known as the Lord of the Flies because his tightly woven web of intrigue traps even the smallest fly. In recent centuries he has been cursed with a new hideous form by the Lord of the Nine Hells-Asmodeus. This form has earned him a new title-The Slug Archduke. Baalzebul was originally known as Triel, one of the most powerful and beautiful angels to be found in Celestia. Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch. However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted. Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil. Any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him. Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even if trapped in the form of a slug, he is still the Lord of Lies, whose every deception is made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind. Only other devils are safe from his lies, as Baalzebul wishes to return to his original beautiful form. If forced into combat Baalzebul's first tactic is to belch out gargantuan clouds of flesh-devouring flies. Baalzebul's stench is so putrid that simply trying to get anywhere close to him is sickening. Despite his bloated form, he can still burrow underground and easily scale surfaces. He is easy to track, since he always leaves a thick layer of putrid slime in his wake.</p>"

    "description": "<p>With the Blood War raging for eons and no end in sight, opportunities abound for ambitious archdevils to win fame, glory, and power in the ongoing struggle against the demons. Duke Bael, one of Mammon's most important vassals, has won fame and acclaim for his victories. Charged with leading sixty-six companies of barbed devils, Bael has proven to be a tactical genius, earning esteem for himself and his master as a result of victory after victory over the abyssal host. Mammon relies on Bael, because of his battle acumen, to safeguard his holdings. Mammon has never been ousted during a time when so many other archdevils have lost their positions, which is a testament to Bael's skill on the battlefield. For his accomplishments, as well as for the hue of his skin, Baal has been granted the title of Bronze General. His accolades notwithstanding, Bael has had a difficult time navigating the quagmire of infernal politics. His critics call him naive, though never to his face. His primary interest has always been leading soldiers in battle, so he finds it frustrating to have his ambitions of ascending to a higher rank constantly stymied by politically shrewd rivals. Bael prefers to make servants out of his adversaries, and mortals bound to his service earn their wretched place by falling victim to Bael's superior stratagems. Bael gladly spares the lives of those he defeats, but only if they pledge their souls and service to him. Although he is willing to corrupt almost any being in this way, he always destroys any demons he defeats. Bael also welcomes mortals into his service if they can provide him with an advantage in his own politicking. He recruits savvy individuals and relies on them to represent his interests at Mammon's court, which leaves Bael free to pursue his battle lust. Despite his lack of interest in affairs outside battle, or perhaps because of it, Bael has gained a small following of cultists. Those who worship at his altar call him the King of Hell, and the most deluded believe that he is the lord of all devils. In arcane circles, certain writings, such as the dreaded Book of Fire, say that Bael revealed the invisibility spell to the world, though some scholars of magic hotly refute such claims. Bael is sometimes depicted as a toad, a cat, a male human, or some combination of these forms, though none of these images reflect his true appearance.</p>"

    "description": "<p>A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through vile magic, these components take on an enormous and horrific upright shape resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper that swallows the unwary. Hags have devised a ritual for creating banderhobbs-a hag who knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other wicked Fey and powerful Fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages. During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out its creator's bidding. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or causes. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or another object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away. A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of an ominous tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform and banderhobbs roam.</p>"

The creature emerges in the form of a goblin, then develops the ability to assume its true form: that of a large, fiendish canine. The mission of every barghest, implanted in it by the General of Gehenna, is to consume seventeen goblinoid souls by devouring the bodies of those it kills. Souls consumed in this way are prevented from joining Maglubiyet's forces in Acheron. A barghest hungers for the day when it can complete its mission, return to Gehenna, and serve the General directly in his yugoloth legions, but it doesn't kill goblinoids indiscriminately. By devouring the souls of goblinoid leaders and other powerful individuals, rather than lowly goblins, a barghest earns elevated status in the afterlife. Barghests typically keep their true nature secret, preying upon a goblin or two when the opportunity arises, until they reach adult age and are old and strong enough to seek out stronger prey. When goblins discover that a barghest is among them, they react with groveling obeisance, each member of the tribe eager to show the barghest that it isn't worthy of being devoured.</p>"

 "lair actions": "<p>The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure.

The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult. </p><p><strong>Moon Devils.</strong> Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter.  A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. </p><p>If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of 1d10 days, allowing plant life in the area to recover. </p>",

 "description": "<p>Lunar dragons (also known as moon dragons or phase dragons) are capricious, xenophobic creatures that make their lairs inside desolate moons by burrowing through the rock.  Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food;  she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves.  Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color.  Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age.  Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate. </p><p>Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves.  Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the Astral Adventurer's Guide) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.  A lunar dragon can become incorporeal, but not to the extent that it can pass through other creatures or solid objects.  In this semi-incorporeal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form. </p>"

 "description": "<p>The thunderous clash of conflict is part of the very nature of sapphire dragons.  Militant and territorial, they defend their lairs fiercely, ambushing intruders and plotting assaults against their rivals.  The sonic pulse of their breath weapon sows weakness, leaving the victims unable to fight back. </p><p>Sapphire dragons' scales and wing membranes show varied shades of blue, ranging from the light tones of a spring sky to the rich, crystalline azure of sapphire gems and compressed glacial ice.  In the light, the scales glitter and shine like luminous starbursts.  The dragons' psionic nature is evident in the horn and bone structures of their bodies.  Their tail barbs and horn tips are all separate pieces, but they float in place, held aloft by psychic energy while the dragons live.  These levitating horns and spines shift slightly with the dragons' moods, bobbing in amusement or flaring with anger. </p><p>The warlike sapphire dragons devise strategies and ambushes based on their ability to maneuver underground.  A sapphire dragon often refrains from striking immediately, preferring to assess intruders first in order to devise the most advantageous approach to dealing with them.  Sapphire dragons watch for signs of Aberrations and other creatures corrupted by the Far Realm.  They frequently ally with emerald dragons, drawing on their kin's knowledge of occult phenomena to track the influence of the Far Realm.  Armed with that knowledge, sapphire dragons stamp out alien influence before it spreads.  People who dwell or delve deep beneath the earth can easily find themselves at odds with a sapphire dragon if they cross into the dragon's territory.  But sapphire dragons sometimes forge peaceful relationships with rock gnomes or deep gnomes, relying on these folk to help protect the territory surrounding their lairs. </p><p>Sapphire dragons' favorite prizes are weapons and armor, records of military history and tactics, and magic items that protect against psychic damage or mental intrusion.  The centerpiece of a sapphire dragon's hoard is usually a cataloged, orderly collection of war gear, which can contain ancient relics of immense power.</p><p>Sapphire dragons make their homes in extensive cave systems.  As they grow older, they make increasingly complex renovations to their lairs, using their inherent magic and natural tunneling abilities to great effect.  Eventually, a sapphire dragon's lair is a dizzying honeycomb of hidden passages, deceptively thin walls, and secret chambers that allow the dragon to travel from one end to the other unseen by intruders.  The most secure lairs might feature no accessible entrances or exits at all, with the dragon relying on tunneling or shaping stone to come and go.  The challenge rating of a legendary sapphire dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.</p>"

    "description": "<p>Immortal and unpredictable, arch-hags hoard secrets and strike magical bargains, altering fate to indulge their fickle whims.  These timeless schemers pursue the secrets of the multiverse and work strange magic in pursuit of their inscrutable goals.  Arch-hags are unpredictable, self-interested, and greedy, with bizarre fascinations and affectations. Nevertheless, they often make deals to further their plots.  These hags are fonts of secret knowledge, particularly lore regarding forbidden magic and multiversal secrets.  They might share their knowledge, but their secrets always have a price.  In trade for their secrets, arch-hags might request peculiar errands, valuable magic items, or preternatural currency, like one's memories, a year of one's life, or the ability to cry.  Most arch-hags avoid battle, but if forced to fight, they unleash dangerous magic, such as spectral claws, arcing lightning, and mind-bending spells.  An arch-hag can curse other magic-users, confounding the spellcasters' incantations and forcing the spellcasters to say the opposite of what they mean.  Even if an arch-hag is brought low, its preparations allow it to magically slip away and begin plotting its revenge.  Every arch-hag has a unique weakness tied to a fateful encounter the hag had in the past or something that embodies the antithesis of the hag's magic.  A hag goes out of its way to keep this vulnerability secret.  Although an arch-hag isn't physically harmed by its weakness, it can be destroyed only while its weakness is nearby.  Roll on or choose a result from the Arch-hag Anathemas table to inspire an arch-hag's weakness. </p>"
