I've completed the course on codecademy called [Deploy a Website][deploying-weblink]. I completed every step minus the Amazon hosting section.

Using Jekyll is pretty simple (and I like the simple server command).

To launch a server that will serve up an "Jekyll-enabled" directory, use this command:
`jekyll serve`

This Jekyll server will watch for changes to any basic static files (.html, .css, .js, .markdown, etc.).

To see your locally hosted site, point your browser to `localhost:4000`. The 4000 port is the default and I don't recall where you can change that port value but I'm sure Google knows.
