					<h1>Basics of Creating UV Maps</h1>
					<p class="about">
						This tutorial covers the basics of generating UV projections, editing UV points, exporting UV maps to Photoshop, and bringing the
						finished texture map back into Maya. This tutorial assumes that the user has a fundamental understanding of the Maya interface, has
						some knowledge of polygonal modeling, and has experience with editing raster-based images in Photoshop. Note: Some of the steps and
						proceeds may need adjusting if you are using version 6 and up.

				                	points do not affect the geometry's makeup (position) but rather how the material maps wrap around the surface.

				                	One quick way to get all the UVs back inside the upper right UV Grid, is to use the <span class="strong">Automatic Mapping function
				                	found under Edit Polygons &gt; Texture &gt; Automatic Mapping</span>. Using this function will break the UVs down into
				                	"chunks". Figure 4 illustrates these chunks with the default settings for Automatic Mapping.
				                </p>
				                <p>
				                	Use other projection tools to map out areas that you wish to use in high detail areas. For our fish friend here, I want
				                	to have detail areas of the body, fins, and mouth region. Start picking the larger areas first by selecting the polygonal
				                	faces of the body.
				                </p>
				                <p>
				                	Open up the tool options for Planar Projection (<span class="strong">Edit Polygons &gt; Texture &gt; Planar Projection &gt; Option
				                	Box</span>). Select <span class="strong">Camera under Mapping Direction</span>. By selecting the Camera option, Maya will unwrap
				                	UVs according to whichever window you have activate. In case of our fishy friend, I activated the side view by clicking
				                	on the empty portion of the side viewport menu. <span class="strong">Activate viewports will have a blue outline</span> indicating
				                	that this viewport is active. In the Polygon Planar Projection Options window, I hit the Project button to layout the
				                	UVs of the body.

				                	both sides and created the projection as I just mentioned, I would have overlapping UVs. Some times, you will want to
				                	overlap UVs to save UV layout space, texture memory and file size. Other times (more often than not), you should keep your

				                	enough and a bazillion projects will be too much (unless of course you have a bazillion faces).

				                	Immediately after creating a projection with a selected set of faces, in the UV Texture Editor (UVTE) window, you will
				                	notice that the selected faces will have a Manupilator-like tool selecting them. You can move, rotate and scale according.
				                	At this point, it is strongly recommended that you move your selection to an unused area of this the UVTE window. This
				                	will prevent overlapping UVs. Think of the UVTE window as a staging area where you can dump all your UV sets like puzzle
				                	pieces on a tabletop. These pieces will sit there until you move them into their final resting place.

				                <p>
				                	Be careful as you create new projections and move old selections around not to unintentionally stretch or pull UV sets.
				                	Stretching UVs from their original projections will cause the texture map(s) assigned to this surface to stretch and/or
				                	pull which will lead to bad looking textures.

				                	before we can export these UVs out to a texture file to be edited in Photoshop. This is where you must make the final
				                	decision on what gets the most detail level and what gets secondary detail levels and so on. Chances are, you will have
				                	to scale each UV set so that you fit all the UVs back into the upper right UV Grid. Pick the highest detail UV sets first
				                	and move them into the upper right UV Grid and uniformly scale them to fit inside. In the case of my fish, I scale the
				                	body down to near 50%, the lower fins to 25%, inner mouth cavity about 15%, face about 30%, and the other fins about 32%.
				                	The no detail or low detail areas I scale down the most and tucked them away in a small opening. Figure 10 shows where I
				                	laid everything out and how I prepared the UVs for export.
