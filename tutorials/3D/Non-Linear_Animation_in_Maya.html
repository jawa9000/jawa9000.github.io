					<h1>Non-Linear Animation: Animating with the Trax Editor in Maya 4.5 and 5</h1>
					<p class="lead">
						This tutorial assumes that the user has knowledge of Maya's interface and how to create keyframe animation
						on both character rigs and simple objects. This tutorial will cover or touch all aspects of Maya's Trax Editor
						and various techniques used to create non-linear animation.
					</p>
					<p class="about">
						Disclaimer: The information covered here works for Maya version 4.5 and 5.0. There are significant upgrades to
						Maya's Trax Editor in version 6 and beyond.

				                	If the animation cycle(s) were short and used just once, it would not be in your better interests
				                	to spend the time to set up the NLA. You should only use NLA techniques if the motions you are
				                	planning to build and use will be repeated in your current project or they can be adapted to
				                	future projects.

				                <p>1. Planning your animation</p>
				                <ul>
									<li>Once you have decided what animation you will be using, you need to make sure the animation
										that you will use can be looped or blended from one cycle to the next.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>2. Planning the animation cycles</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										As you build you animation cycles, keep in mind that the cycles need to loop well if you plan
										on using repetitively.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>3. "How long should my cycle be?"</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										As long as it needs to be. A cycle that is very short (lets say 6-30 frames) repeats very quickly.
										After a while, the viewer will start seeing the (re)cycling of animation and get bored with it.
										If you make the cycle too long (more than 20 seconds) then the data used to make that cycle may
										be inefficient use of memory and should be breakdown down into small cycles. A good animator knows
										to break up the cycle a little bit to keep the animation from getting boring. A good example to
										making a walk cycle more interesting would be adding a little skip or hop somewhere in the middle
										of the cycle. Using NLA techniques, this can be very easy to accomplish.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>4. Making a clean cycle</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										To start with, your cycle should start and end on the same stance or pose. However, if you
										stop here, your cycle will have a short hesitation because the first and last frames are
										exactly the same. To correct that, insert a new key a frame or two just before the last
										keyframe and delete the last keyframe.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p>5. Return stances</p>
								<p>What is a return stance or neutral stance?</p>
						    	<ol>
						        	<li>
						        		In gaming, a return stance is a pose the character assumes when he/she is not in
						        		motion. Usually, the pose is very neutral in positioning the legs, arms, hands and
						        		head.
					        		</li>
						      		<li>
						      			More often than not, this neutral pose is standing upright. The arms are comfortably
						      			at your side. Your legs are placed next to each other and neither one is ahead of
						      			the other. The hands return to the previous state (whether that was holding a weapon,
						      			making a fist or being in a slightly closed position). The head should return to
						      			looking forward and the chin level to the shoulders.
					      			</li>
						    	</ol>
