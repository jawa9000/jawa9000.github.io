				                </p>
				                <ul>
									<li>Bind to = Complete Skeleton. Or you can choose Selected Joints that does just as it says.</li>
								  	<li>
								  		Bind Method = Closest Joint. This option tells Maya to bind the vertices by proximity of the joint or distance from
								  		each joint. The latter usually involves lots of painting weights later on.
								  	</li>
								  	<li>Max Influences = 5. The number of influence limits to how many joints can share the weight of any given vertex.</li>
								  	<li>Dropoff Rate = 4.0. Dropoff rate tells Maya how much to decrease the influence of each vertex from each joint.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Click on <span class="strong">Bind Skin</span>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now that we have the geometry skinned, you need to test the rotation of each joint to see where we need to prune or edit
									the vertex weights. Here are some tips for searching for identifying errant vertex weights.

				                	<span class="strong">Select all the vertices of the geometry</span> and go to <span class="strong">Window &gt; General Editors &gt; Component
				                	Editor</span>.

				                <p>
				                	Select the <span class="strong">Smooth Skins tab</span> and scan the window for tiny weight on vertices. Chances are, those tiny
				                	weights are on the wrong joint. I don't have any particular rule of thumb for how much weight is too little but I usually
				                	prune anything that is below the value of 0.05.
				                </p>
				                <p>
				                	You can remove/adjust these weights in the Component Editor by simply typing in a new value. Note: If you type if a value
				                	of 0, Maya will average that weight to the next one or more joints near it that already has weight. It won't add weight
				                	to any joint that does not have weight to that particular vertex. If you type in a value more than what was originally
				                	there (lets say from 0.1 to 0.2), Maya will subtract an average weight from all the other joints listed under the
				                	vertices under their influence. Example: If vertex 130 (vtx130) is weighted evenly between three joints (weight = 0.333)
				                	and you want to take away all the weight from one joint, the remaining joints will equally share the removed value to
				                	both the joints (weight now equals 0.5).

				                	more weight to a joint if I want to lessen weight from another joint. This is best done by lowering the
				                	<span class="strong">Opacity to 0.1 to 0.25</span> and leave the <span class="strong">Paint Weights Value at 1</span>. Figure 26 illustrates
