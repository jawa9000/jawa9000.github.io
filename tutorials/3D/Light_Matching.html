								    <li>
								    	When trying to match indoor lighting, it is important to know what types of light bulbs are being used. Each type of
								    	light bulb has a different temperature of operation and color pitch. Example: fluorescent light bulbs (long tubes)
								    	typically have a greenish or yellowish balance. Halogen lights have a more balanced white source but some have a
								    	bluish tint as well.

								    <li>
								    	Enough though an old brick wall looks great and has lots of rich red colors in it, it may not cast off much light
								    	because of how much light is being absorbed. Think about the material's ability to absorb light.

							        	<li>Bounce light takes on a color tint/shade of whatever material is suppose to be bouncing off of.</li>
							        	<li>Bounce light fades in intensity as it goes further from the source.</li>
							        	<li>Bounce light can, and often does, produce shadows. However, these shadows may be extremely faint and hard to make out.</li>
