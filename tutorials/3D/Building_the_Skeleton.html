				                	We use 3-4 joints for the belly region because the majority of the torso movement comes from this area due to the
				                	physics of the rib cage and lack of bones in the lower torso region. Since the upper torso does not move all that
				                	much (just skin pulling over the rib cage) we only really need one joint to skin these vertices.

				                	The main reason you want to work in the side view is to keep the joints in a start alignment. Angling (not straight up

									<li>
										Second joint is the knee. Place directly center of the geometry for the knee region. This hinge joint handles

									<li>
										The third joint is the ankle. Place this hinge joint in the center of the geometry for the ankle region. This
										joint should not be confused with the heel joint.
									</li>
									<li>
										The fourth joint is the heel joint. This hinge joint is placed at the rear of the foot geometry. I use this
										joint to handle the rotation of the foot when performing a heel pivoting motion. Some animators skip over this
										joint and go straight from the ankle to the ball joint. This is fine as long you don't plan on using a more
										complex system for animating the foot.
									</li>
									<li>
										The fifth joint is the ball joint. Place this hinge joint in the center of the foot (exact averaged distance
										from toe to heel). This joint is responsible for bending the foot upper when picking the foot up.
									</li>
									<li>
										The final joint is the toe joint. Place this non-moving joint at the very tip of the foot where the toes are.
										This joint has no bending responsibilities but it is useful in some situations for better skin weighting of
										the foot.
