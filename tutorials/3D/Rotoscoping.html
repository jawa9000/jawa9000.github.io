				            		<li>Time Stamped DV tapes</li>
				            		<ol>
				            			<li>
				            				Before shooting, make sure your tape has been time stamped (blacked out). When capturing footage, it is very
				            				important to have the tape time stamped. Premiere reads the time stamp in a linear fashion. If you have not
				            				blacked out the tape, each time you remove the DV tape from the camcorder or shut it off, a new time stamp is
				            				made when you start recording again. Premiere will get confused over which time stamp to follow when you are
				            				capturing the footage. If you time stamped the entire tape, the camcorder will not rewrite the time stamp every
				            				time you turn the camera on/off or remove the tape repeatedly.
				            			</li>
				            			<li>
				            				To black out a tape, put the DV tape in the camera, leave the lens on, and disable the microphone. Hit the
				            				record button and let the camcorder roll until the tape has recorded 60 minutes of complete black and silence.
				            				Rewind the tape and mark it so that you know you time stamped this tape. I usually write TS in the corner of
				            				the top label or make a little box and fill it in.
				            			</li>
				            		</ol>
				            		<li>Acting Area (Stage)</li>
				            		<ul>
				            			<li>
				            				Clear your area of any visual impairment. This includes foreground elements (things that get in between your
				            				motion actor and the camera lens), excessively busy background elements (highway travel, extras (children in
				            				the background), and middle ground elements (tall grass, big tree limbs, etc.). Keep the camera frame open so
				            				we don't have to guess where to stop and need to do some unnecessary editing or lose a good take.
				            			</li>
				            			<li>
				            				Place markers in your "acting area" to give you an idea of your stage. Look through the viewfinder and place
				            				strips of tape or some sort of marker on the ground. You don't want to be acting outside your camera's visual
				            				range. If possible and you are working outside, use a basketball or tennis court. These areas are usually
				            				marked well and are great for shooting because they are clean, level and free of debris.
				            			</li>
				            			<li>
				            				Shoot a placement shot to test the distance of the camera and mark the location with tape (indoors) or tree
				            				limbs (outdoors) so you have a reference to where your shooting range will be.
				            			</li>
				            			<li>
				            				Practice your motion(s) at least 2-3 times before shooting. Get an idea of what, when, and where things happen.
				            				Do you need to hit a mark at a certain time? Where are your arms and legs in relation to the camera's lens?
				            			</li>
				            			<li>
				            				Review your storyboards. What do they tell you to do? When do you need to complete an action? How do they tell
				            				you to complete the action?
				            			</li>

				                			Use straight-on angles. Try to avoid moving at an angle to the camera. This will
				                			make the rotoscoping process difficult. If you must move at angle to the camera, shoot multiple takes of the
				                			action with multiple angles.

				                		<li>
				                			Tape pre-roll: Start recording and let the tape roll for a few seconds before you start your motions. Let the
				                			pre-roll go for a minimum of 10 seconds if it's at the beginning of the tape, everything else can have a
				                			pre-roll of 3 seconds. The reason we need this pre-roll is purely a digital reason. Adobe Premiere needs at
				                			least a few seconds to cue up the tape to proper location to start capturing information. If we don't give it
				                			enough pre-roll, you might cut off some of those precious moments we have been trying to capture. Don't worry
				                			about the length of the pre-rolls eating up your tape time. You will burn up more tape with takes and retakes
				                			more than anything else.
				                		</li>
				                		<li>
				                			Shoot at least three takes of each motion. Sometimes, we know the motion we want to capture but don't know
				                			quite how to act it out. Other times, we get a little self-conscious (even though no one is around) and this
				                			will mess up your performance.
				                		</li>
				                		<li>
				                			Tape post-roll: Let the tape roll a few seconds after you've finished your motions.
				                		</li>
				                		<li>
				                			Review the footage on-site. Look for mistakes, cutting your head, legs, arms out the shot, missed cues,
				                			good timing and placement. It is better now to look for mistakes than to try to sort them out on the computer
				                			later when you don't have access to that open space again.

				                	This step isn't as difficult as it may seem but problems may arise if your camcorder is not capable with Premiere's
				                	DV Device Manager and/or your hard drive is slower than 7200rpm. The hard drive speed is important because there is

										When we are in Premiere and everything is set up properly, we can control the camcorder remotely via Premiere.
										At this point, you may want to use a power supply that is not battery dependant. Most camcorders have a built in
										feature that turns off the camera or goes to sleep after a few minutes of being idle. This will disconnect the
										communication between Premiere and the camcorder. But most camcorders that are powered by electrical outlet means

									<li>
										Start Premiere. The camcorder must be connected to the computer by the firewire, powered and in VCR mode before

										don't follow these steps in order prior to starting the program, then Premiere won't detect the connected devices.

				                	When exporting the movie, you may want to modify the output size if you are on a slower computer. Clip areas of the
				                	footage that are not used. For example, if you motion actor never leaves the center of the frame, you can clip the
				                	sides off and reduce the file size greatly.
								</p>
								<p>
									Use only formats that are supported by the software you will be using this footage in Maya like uncompressed .AVIs,
									image sequences (Targa, Tiff, Jpeg, Bitmaps). I don't use the latter two because they are a lossy format. You can
									use image sequences, but I would not recommend it. Setting Maya up to receive image sequences is more complicated than
									necessary in comparison to using a movie clip.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you are not capturing facial animation or the clip you are going to animate is not sound dependant, disable the
									audio export option as well.

									<li>
										The first thing we want to do in Maya is make sure the program is set up for rotoscoping animation. Playback should
										be set to 30fps and set the undo limits to Unlimited. To change your playback settings, go to Window &gt;
										Settings/Preferences &gt; Preferences. Click on the Settings Category and make sure that Time says NTSC (30 fps).
										While the Preferences window is still open, go to the Undo Category and set the Undo options to Undo = On and
										Queue = Infinite. Setting the Queue to Infinite will require more memory but its better to have the option to back
										out of something if necessary rather than having to restart the file again and again.
									</li>
									<li>Turn on Texture view in the persp viewport (keyboard shortcut 6).</li>
									<li>
										Create a NURBS plane with the portions of the footage. Since this is a PC and a DV format image file, the movie
										file's dimensions should be 720 x 486 unless you modified the output size. The image plane should have the same
										ratio as the movie clip. To make the image size more manageable in Maya, divide the width and height by 100.
										Create a plane and set the ScaleX to the width of the clip divided by 100. Set the ScaleZ to the height of the clip
										divided by 100. Don't worry about the size of the image plane in relation to the character just yet.
									</li>
									<li>Name this plane reference plane. Put this plane in a layer and name the layer Reference.</li>
									<li>Rotate the reference plane so that it sits upright and parallel to your character.</li>

									<li>Create and link a new Lambert shader to the reference plane.</li>
									<li>Link the footage to the color attribute of the shader via a movie file.</li>
									<li>Maya will create a node labeled movie1. Click the folder icon and select the clip and hit Open.</li>
									<li>
										We now see the first frame of the clip but if you scrub through the timeline at this point, you will not see the
										footage update. We need to tell Maya to display each frame of the clip. Enable Use Frame Extension in the Attribute
										Editor of the movie1 node.
									</li>
									<li>
										Next we need to tell the Frame Extension to update every frame when we slide through the Time Range. We can either
										set keyframes on the Frame Extension to mark the beginning and end of the clip or use a simple expression.
										Right-click and hold on the attribute Frame Extension and go to Create New Expression.
									</li>
									<li>In the Expression window of the Expression Editor, type in the following expression: movie1.frameExtension=frame</li>
									<li>Hit Create and close the Expression Editor. Replace movie1 with the name of movie file node if it is not named movie1.</li>
									<li>
										Rescale the surface uniformly to match the size of your character. For example, I'm 6' tall guy and my character is
										about 3.4cm. The reference plane is a relative instrument that we can use to better suit the CG character. I guess
										what I'm trying to say is that it is a lot easier to resize a single plane than an entire character rig and surface.
									</li>
									<li>Position the reference plane behind the character. Match up the angle you shot with on the camcorder.</li>
									<li>
										Turn the on the Reference mode for the Reference layer once you are done scaling and placing the reference plane.
										Referencing this layer prevents you from accidentally selecting and moving the reference plane.

										Apply the principles of animation where they are needed. Remember the twelve principles of animation your teacher
										rammed down your throat when you were first learning animation? Well, use what you need, not all of them!
									</li>
									<li>
										Find the major and minor poses in the footage and create key poses with your character to match. Don't worry about
										the inbetweens just yet. Keyframe the body first, then the feet, arms, neck/head and the fingers last.
									</li>
									<li>
										Use the Graph Editor to modify the animation curves to adjust the ease in and ease out of some of the motions
									</li>
									<li>
										Adjust the timing of the animation once you have completed the sequence. Use the Dope Sheet for major changes in
										timing but use the graph editor for minor changes.
									</li>
									<li>
										Playblast everything after the major edits have been made. Depending on how fast your computer is, your playback
										speed will not give you a true representation of the timing or speed of the motion. Remember you are translating
										motion information for a 2D image that may have different portions from your virtual actor to the actual actor.
									</li>
									<li>
										Animate beyond the second dimension! If you recall, this animation is based off of a 2D image plane and you will
										not have some motion information because of the angle(s) of the character to your performer. You won't always
										have the visual information of where the actor's opposite arm is sitting. You may remember but where but do you
										remember the timing of where it was at and when?
									</li>
									<li>
										Adlib a bit from time to time. Give your virtual actor a little more action than what the actual taped performance did.
									</li>
									<li>
										The graph editor is your friend. Use it wisely and often! This is where the majority of the animation cleanup will
										take place.

				                	Build yourself a library of motion. Videotape people walking, talking, animals running about and playing. DV tapes are
				                	relatively cheap nowadays and hard drives are getting bigger and bigger all the time while the prices is dropping.
				                	Building a library can save you some time and money in the long run.
