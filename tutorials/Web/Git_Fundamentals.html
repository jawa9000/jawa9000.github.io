					<p class="lead">Welcome to Git Fundamentals. This reference guide is meant to serve as a basic instructional document on what Git is and how to use some of it's basic
						features.</p>
					<p class="lead"><strong>Goals of this guide:</strong> By the end of this document, you should have a good understanding of how to create a repository, configure Git, use
						basic commands, and to create and manage repositories and branches. This document will not cover workflows (based on personal experience, every individual and company
						uses Git in a slightly different manner). Finally, this document will list a series of links for <a href="#Resources">further reading</a> on all these topics and more.</p>
					<p class="lead">This document assumes you have already downloaded and installed Git on your machine. If you have not done this yet, please visit Git's

					            <p><strong>Git</strong> is a <strong>version control system</strong> (VCS) that is data centric. While other VCSs (Subversion, CVS, and so on) keep information
					            	as a set of files and changes made over time, Git thinks of the data as <strong>snapshots</strong> of a small filesystem. Every commit in Git is snapshot
					            	what was changed and just stores those individual changes instead of making a snapshot of every file.</p>
                            	<p>Using Git may seem odd for those users coming from other VCSs or for newcomers but the good news it that Git has both a <strong>GUI</strong> and a
                            		<strong>command-line interface</strong>. With that being said, this reference guide will not cover the GUI. It's a good thing to know what's happening
                            		&quot;under the hood&quot; before taking advantage of the GUI. This reference guide will provide you with some common commands that every good Git user
                            		should know. </p>

                                <p>One of the first things you did was set up your name and e-mail address with your repository. You should set up your name and email for the repository so
                                	you can see who committed what when working in a team environment.</p>
                                <p><code class="inline">git config --global user.name "&lt;first lastname&gt;"</code> - set up the user name for the repository.</p>

                                <p>A <strong>repository</strong> is essentially a project. One can imagine a repository as a project's folder with all the related files inside of it. In fact,
                                	that's what it will look like on your computer anyways. You tell Git what your project is and Git will start tracking all of the changes to that folder.
                                	Files added or subtracted or even a single letter in a single file changed -- all of it's tracked and time stamped by Git. That's
                                	<strong>version control</strong>.</p>
                                <p>When you start a new project, you want to initialize your project using the <code class="inline">git init</code> command. This command will set up all the
                                	necessary pieces to start version controlling your files.</p>

                                <p>In order to use version control, you need to add and commit files (a snapshot). You can rollback versions, split, and so on but we'll get to that later.</p>
                                <p>To add a file to the repository, you use this command:</p>
                                <code id="code-add" class="block">
                                	<div>git add &lt;file name&gt;</div>
                                </code>
                                <p>Once you've made changes to a file, you'll need to commit the changes to the repository:</p>
                                <code id="code-commit" class="block">
                                	<div>git commit -m '&lt;message&gt;'</div>
                                </code>
                                <p>This commit command will commit a change to the file to the project with a message that you specify. It is very important to leave a meaningful message on
                                	your commit. Other developers (and future you) can review what was committed, notes, next steps, or any other useful information that you want to communicate
                                	with this commit.</p>
                                <p>To see the status of your repository, that is, to see if you have any un-checked in files, use the status command: <code class="inline">git status</code>.</p>

                                <p>Before the end of the day or merging branches, you should check to see the status of your repository. To do this, you use the
                                	<code class="inline">git status</code> command. This command will give you a verbose report of which branch you're on, items not staged, and some commands
                                	to help stage those files.</p>
                                <p><code class="inline">git status -s</code> - shows a status next to the file(s). What's the status characters mean?</p>

                                  <li>' ' = (no character) unmodified</li>

                                  <li><strong>A</strong> = added; File's content has been added to the repository but not committed yet.</li>
                                  <li><strong>D</strong> = deleted; File has been removed from repository and from the directory. To remove a file but keep it in the filesystem (directory),
                                  	use the <code class="inline">--cached</code> flag.</li>
                                  <li><strong>R</strong> = renamed; File has been renamed.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>If you run this status command and the it comes back empty, then there is nothing staged (waiting) and the repository is "clean".</p>

								<p>At times, it may be necessary to remove files from your repository. Using the <code class="inline">git rm</code> is the command used to remove files but it
									may be better to use various flags if you want to remove it from the repository, directory, or both.</p>
                                <p><code class="inline">git rm -f &lt;file name&gt;</code> - force removes &lt;file name&gt; from repository and directory. This flag is handy as it prevents you
                                	from removing changed files that have not been committed yet. Be careful using this command with this flag as it will remove your file from disk as well.</p>
                                <p><code class="inline">git rm --cached &lt;file name&gt; </code>- removes &lt;file name&gt; from repository (just removes from Git and keeps it on disk). Side
                                	note: if you decide to add the file back into Git and you didn't change the name of the file, the history (log) will still be intact.</p>
                                <p><code class="inline">git mv</code> - moves or renames a file. Works the same as the Unix command but file must first be added to Git.</p>

					            </div>
                                <p>Git repositories use <strong>branches</strong> to isolate work when needed. It is a common practice when working on a project or with others to create a
                                	branch to keep your changes in until they are ready. This way you can work in other branch(es) while the 'master' branch stays stable. When your branch is
                                	ready, you merge it back into master.</p>
                                <p>Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. In many VCS tools, this is a
                                	somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory which can take a long time and excessive amounts of disk
                                	space for large projects.</p>

                                <p>Git merge allows you to join two or more development branches, or histories, together. Merging integrates changes from the named commits (since the time
                                	their histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This command is used by <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull" target="_blank">git pull</a>
                                	to incorporate changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.</p>
                                <p><code class="inline">git merge &lt;source&gt;</code> - merges &lt;source&gt; branch into current branch.</p>
