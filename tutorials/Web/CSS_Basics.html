                                <p>CSS stands for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> which is used for describing how a web page should look and formatted for various devices such as
                                	desktops, mobile devices (large and small), and printers. The separation of CSS and HTML makes it easier for web developers to maintain sites, share style
                                	sheets throughout an entire site, and make tweaks to pages on different display environments. This is referred to as separation of structure from content.
                                	Style sheets consist of a list of rules or rule-sets that consist of one or more selectors and declaration blocks.</p>
								<p>In this guide, we will cover the basics of style sheets, what and how to use selectors, priority scheme of CSS rules, inheritance, and finish off with some
									thoughts on debugging your CSS rules. This guide assumes that you have a basic understanding of HTML elements, properties, and fundamental structure of a
									web page. Take out a sheet of paper (digital or otherwise) and prepare yourself for some "rad" styling with style sheets!</p>

                                <p><strong>Style sheets</strong> are a way to express <strong>CSS rules</strong> either internally to the HTML page or externally by including the
                                	<strong>.css</strong> file via a link in the head of the page.</p>
                                <p>One of the most basic ways to apply styling to an element is via an element's <strong>style property</strong>. However, this is not recommended if you plan
                                	on maintaining an entire site. But if you must do so, here's what a inline-styled element might look like:</p>
                                <code id="code-inline" class="block">
                                	<div>&lt;span style=&quot;color:orange&quot;&gt;some orange text&lt;/span&gt;</div>
                                </code>
                                <p><strong>Internal style sheets</strong> should be discouraged if you plan on using the CSS rules across multiple pages. Internal style sheets are good for
                                	testing out something on a single page or for unique rules to just that page. I personally don't like using internal style sheets as my personal work flow
                                	rarely checks for CSS found within the HTML document itself.</p>
                                <p>If you wish to use an internal style sheet, place the following code in the head of your page:</p>
                                <code id="code-internal" class="block">
                                	<div>&lt;head&gt;</div>
                                	<div><span class="indent36">&lt;style&gt;</span></div>
                                    <div><span class="indent72">&lt;your rules here&gt;</span></div>
                                	<div><span class="indent108">...</span></div>
                                	<div><span class="indent36">&lt;/style&gt;</span></div>
                                	<div>&lt;/head&gt;</div>
                                </code>
								<p><strong>External style sheets</strong> allows you to control all CSS rules from one file that can affect all your HTML files on your site. To link an
									 external style sheet to a page, use the following code:</p>
                              	<code id="code-external" class="block">
                                	<div>&lt;head&gt;</div>
                                	<div><span class="indent36">&lt;style rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"&gt;</span></div>
                                	<div>&lt;/head&gt;</div>
                              	</code>
                              	<div class="note">
                              		<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-file"></span>
                              		<p>One common practice is to have a handful of CSS files (one main file that lists commonly used rules throughout the site) and another CSS file for uncommon
                              		rules (for one offs or specialized pages). </p>
                              	</div>
                              	<p>You can also create CSS files for different devices but that topic in itself could be another guide. We'll stick with our elected method for calling CSS
                              		rules and move on to selecting elements.</p>

                            	<p>A <strong>selector</strong> is used to declare which part of the markup a rule applies to by matching tags and attributes. Selectors can be picked from</p>
                            	<ul>
                                	<li>Elements</li>
                                    <li>Elements specified by an attribute</li>
                                    <ul>
                                    	<li>id: an unique identifier to the document</li>
                                        <li>class: an group of elements that share the same identifier</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Element's location in the document tree</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Pseudo-classes</strong> are special selectors that allow for formatting based on information that is not found in the document tree. These
                                	pseudo-classes can be related to user events such as hovering over an element, visiting a link, and so forth. We'll cover more about this special selector
                                	type later. For now, let's move onto selector's syntax.</p>

                           	  <p>As stated above, this is a short list of selectors one can use. One of the greatness things about CSS is that you can combination this syntax in very
                               		creative ways to select and manipulate the layout of your elements. For example, <code class="inline">div.foo a:first-child) {color: blue;}</code> would
                               		create a slightly complex rule that applies only to the first link of div elements with the class of 'foo' and turn text color blue. For a more complete

                               		simply Google "CSS Selectors".</p>
                              <p>Now that we understand how to select an element, let's decipher how declaration works on a selected element.</p>

                                <p>Let's look at the example of importance in action. Our CSS has the following conflict of how to affect the div element with the id of menu.</p>
                                <code id="code-priority1" class="block">
	                                <div>div#menu {color: red;}</div>
    	                            <div><span class="indent36">...</span></div>
                                	<div>div#menu {color: blue;}</div>
                                </code>
								<p>Example in action:</p>
                                <code id="priority1" class="block">
                                	<div id="menu">menu text</div>
                                </code>
                                <p>In this case, the last rule in the file wins out and the div element  get a blue text color. However, if we add the '!important' flag to the first rule, it
                                	would win out.</p>
                                <code id="code-priority2" class="block">
	                                <div>div#subMenu {color: red !important;}</div>
    	                            <div><span class="indent36">...</span></div>
                                	<div>div#subMenu {color: blue;}</div>
                                </code>
								<p>Example in action:</p>
                                <code id="priority2" class="block">
                                	<div id="subMenu">menu text</div>
                                </code>
                                <p>This may see a little bit unruly so lets get things back in order by discussing rule order. An element can have more than one class assigned to it. For
                                	example:</p>
                                <code id="code-rule1" class="block">
	                                <div>&lt;div class=&quot;red borderless&quot;&gt;Div element with two classes:<br/>red and borderless&lt;/div&gt;</div>
                                </code>
                                <p>An element can have as many classes as you see fit and here we have a div element with two classes ('red' and 'borderless').</p>
                            	<code id="code-rule2" class="block">
                                	<div>.red {color: red}</div>
    	                            <div>.borderless {</div>
                                    <div><span class="indent36">border: none;</span></div>
                                    <div><span class="indent36">color: blue;</span></div>
                                    <div>}</div>
                            	</code>
                                <p>In this example, the browser would render the red rule first and then override any conflicting rules found within the borderless rule based on it's order in
                                	the style sheet. We can see from these two rules that there is conflict with the text color. Let's see how this plays out.
                                </p>
                                <code id="rule2" class="block">
                                	<div class="red borderless">Div element with two classes: red and borderless</div>
                                </code>
                                <p>Not bad but not too pretty either when you look at the output (debugging mode) on the rendered page. Having clashing rules are common in CSS development.
                                	There are times when you want one rule to override another and other times when you don't. Don't get frustrated when this happens. Yes, it can make keeping
                                	track of rules and their purpose more difficult but it doesn't have to get too ugly. One thing that you can do to help yourself (and others) out is leaving
                                	some notes behind about these rules.</p>

                                <p>A good web developer knows to leave comments in his/her code for several reasons: Other developers can read and understand the purpose of the rules,
                                	disabling a rule or two for debugging purposes, and most importantly, to remind future you what you wrote and why. I look back some of the CSS rules I have
                                	written years ago and scratch my head wondering why I did what I did back then. I'm sure I had a good reason but only if I had left a note or two to give
                                	me a clue.</p>
                                <p>To comment out a section of code, start with /*, then your code, and close off the section with */. For example:</p>

                                <p>In addition to commenting out single lines of code, you can comment out entire blocks of CSS.</p>

                             		properties include color, font, line-height, text-align, and text-transform. Properties not inherited include background, border, display, height, width,

                                <p>The &lt;em&gt; element was not assigned any text color yet it inherited it from it's parent element. If you wish for nested elements to not inherit the

                                <p>These two rules applied to the two elements would render this:</p>

                              	<p>In this example, it may look like the paragraph element has inherited the background from the span element but when we look at the next code example with the
                              		paragraph element also declaring a background color, we'll see that in fact it did not inherited anything. The default property of background of the
                              		paragraph element is set to none which allows for the parent element's property to pass through.</p>
                                <code id="code-inheritance5" class="block">
                                	<div>.bg1 {</div>

                                </code>
                                <p>And now a slightly modified set of HTML elements:</p>
                                <code id="code-inheritance6" class="block">
                               		<div>&lt;div class=&quot;bg1&quot;&gt;</div>
                               		<div><span class="indent36">&lt;p class=&quot;bg2 red&quot;&gt;</span></div>
                               		<div><span class="indent72">Paragraph nested inside a div element</span></div>
                               	    <div><span class="indent36">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div>
                               	    <div>&lt;/div&gt;</div>
                                </code>
                                <code id="inheritance6" class="block">
                                	<div class="bg1"><p class="bg2 red">Paragraph nested inside a div element</p></div>
                                </code>
                                <p>As you can see, the paragraph element (with the class of .bg2) has it's own background color now while the outer element (class of .bg1) has a background
                                	that is different from it's child element.</p>
                                <p>As you can see, inheritance is a powerful tool to use when designing your CSS rules.</p>

                                    <p>Having problems with elements displaying in a way that you didn't expect? Chances are that your elements may have inherited something you didn't intend.
                                    	You can either review potentially hundreds of lines of CSS code or use a browser to debug your code.</p>

				                </div>
				                <p>Finally, one skill that I think every CSS developer should have is the ability to debug or track down what went wrong with their code. You could be cruising
				                	along writing beautiful CSS, you save your file, and test your page only to find that something has gone horribly wrong. A misplaced semi-colon, an unclosed
				                	rule, or even a common typo can render any page visually dead. What do you do now? Would you: A- Turn out the lights and curl up in a ball. B- Consider a
				                	different career. C- Use a debugging tool to find the source of the problem. D- All the above. If you guessed &quot;D&quot;, then you wouldn't be far off
				                	the mark but for the sake of argument, let's say you simply want to debug your CSS.</p>
                              	<p>Most modern browsers come with some sort of debugging tool. If one is not a part of the default package, you can always Google for an extension or plugin that
                              		gives your browser the capability to debug your pages. To keep things simple, I'm going to refer to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools"><strong>Chrome's
                              		Developer Tools</strong></a>.</p>
                           	<div class="images floatRight">
				                	<img src="../../images/tutorials/CSS_Basics/debugger_in_action.gif" id="debugger2" class="imgThumbnail" title="Debugger in action" data-toggle="modal" data-target=".debugger2"/>
			                  </div>
                           	  <p>Once you have your code saved, you should preview your page (in case) using Chrome. To enter the debugging tools, you can hit the F12 shortcut key to launch
                              		the debugger. Once open, a split window will appear at the bottom of your browser. To see the rendered HTML and CSS, right-click on an element and select
                           		  <strong>Inspect Element</strong>. The debugger will show your selected element's HTML code on the left side in the <strong>Elements</strong> section. On the
                           		  right, you'll see the CSS code that is affecting the selected code in the <strong>Styles</strong> section. The selected element's CSS will be broken down any
                           		  and all rules that affect it. Properties and values that are displayed with a strike-through means that this part of the rule is not being executed. You can
                           		  toggle properties and values by checking and unchecking them by clicking the checkbox to the left of the property/value pair. You'll see the checkbox when you
                           		  hover over the properties and values.</p>
                              	<p>What's great here is that you can change the rules in the Styles section and see the rendered result immediately. To change a rule's value, simply click on
                              		the property or value and type in a new property or value. You can also add new properties and values by clicking one of the properties, hitting the Enter
                              		key a few times until you get a new empty line. From there, enter if your new property and value and see the results materialize on the page.</p>
                              	<p>Chrome's Developer Tool also allows you to create a whole new rules on the selected element or by creating a new rule by clicking the New Style Rule button.
                              		In the Styles section, when you have an element selected, you will see an empty rule at the top of the list of rules called <strong>element.style</strong>.
                              		This selected element can receive whatever properties and values you wish to create for it but keep in mind that this new rule only affects the selected
                              		element. If you wish to create a temporary rule, click the <strong>New Style Rule</strong> button, type in your selector and then your properties and values.
                              		Once you're done debugging, or experimenting, be sure to copy and paste your tweaks back into your CSS file.</p>
                              	<p>Chrome's Developer Tools is a power tool to use to debug and experiment when developing your pages. In addition to debugging CSS, you can also debug and
                              		experiment with any other code elements on the page (HTML, JavaScript, etc.) as well as many other powerful features but that would be another topic for
                              		another time.</p>
